                "People with the <b>INTJ personality type</b> (Architects) are intellectually curious individuals with a deep-seated thirst for knowledge. INTJs tend to value creative ingenuity, straightforward rationality, and self-improvement. They consistently work toward enhancing intellectual abilities and are often driven by an intense desire to master any and every topic that piques their interest.",
                "Logical and quick-witted, INTJs pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. Because their minds are never at rest, these personalities may sometimes struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them. But when they do find like-minded individuals who appreciate their intensity and depth of thought, INTJs form profound and intellectually stimulating relationships that they deeply treasure.",
                "<b>A Pioneering Spirit:</b> INTJs question most things, basing their beliefs on solid evidence, reasoning, and rationality. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical INTJ personalities prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval – in fact, they often rather enjoy it. But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn’t worth anything unless it actually works. INTJs want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their work, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. They have little patience for anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism – though astute observations are generally welcome.",
                "This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. INTJs don’t mind acting alone – in fact, they prefer their own company most of the time – perhaps in part because they don’t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. People with this personality type often have no problem making decisions without asking for anyone else’s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration others’ thoughts, desires, and plans. It would be a mistake, however, to view INTJ personalities as uncaring. Whatever the stereotypes about their stoic intellect, they feel deeply. When things go wrong or when they hurt others, they are personally affected and spend much time and energy trying to figure out why things happened the way that they did. These personalities may not always value emotion as a decision-making tool, and they have a very hard time relating to people who lead with their hearts, but they are still authentically human.",
                "<b>A Thirst for Knowledge:</b> INTJs can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. They believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. They are firm believers that taking the easy way out in any given situation prevents people from achieving greatness. But these personalities may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity. People with the INTJ personality type derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, they may have been called “bookworms” or “nerds.” But rather than taking these labels as insults, many people with this type embrace them. They recognize their own ability to teach themselves about – and master – any topic that interests them, whether that’s coding or capoeira or classical music.",
                "<b>Social Frustrations:</b> INTJs aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right than popular. And because these personalities value truth and depth, many common social practices – from small talk to white lies – may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they’re only trying to be honest. But like any personality type, INTJs do crave social interaction – they’d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When they pursue their interests, their authenticity can draw people to them – professionally, socially, and even romantically.",
                "<b>The Chess Game of Life:</b> People with the INTJ personality type are full of contradictions. They are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of this personality type’s mind. For these personalities, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, INTJs contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win – no matter what challenges might arise along the way.",
            ],
            "Strengths & Weaknesses" => [
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>1. Rational: </b> People with the INTJ personality type (Architects) pride themselves on the power of their mind. They can reframe nearly any challenge as an opportunity to hone their rational thinking skills and expand their knowledge – and with this mindset, they can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems.<br><br><b>2. Informed: </b>Few personality types are as devoted as INTJs to developing rational, correct, and evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, they base their conclusions on research and analysis. This gives them the conviction that they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Independent: </b>For people with this personality type, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity. Creative and self-motivated, INTJs strive to do things their own way. They can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing arbitrary rules or conventions to stand in the way of their success. Moreover, they are happy to make decisions without outside input or opinions. These individuals prefer to take matters into their own hands.<br><br><b>4. Determined: </b>This personality type is known for being ambitious and goal-oriented. INTJs won’t rest until they’ve achieved their own definition of success – which usually entails mastering the subjects and pursuits that matter to them. They are not known for taking the easy way out. They feel that the only way to achieve greatness is to face challenges head on.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Curious: </b>INTJs are open to new ideas – as long as those ideas are rational and evidence based, that is. Skeptical by nature, people with this personality type are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. And if the facts prove them wrong, these types are generally happy to revise their opinions.<br><br><b>6. Original: </b>Without INTJs, the world would be a far less interesting place. This personality type’s rebellious streak is responsible for some of history’s most unconventional ideas and inventions. Even in their everyday lives, these personalities force the people around them to consider new (and sometimes surprising) ways of looking at things.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Arrogant: </b>INTJs might be knowledgeable, but they’re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful input from other people – especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. These personalities can also come across as needlessly harsh or single-minded in trying to prove others wrong.<br><br><b>2. Dismissive of Emotions: </b>For this type, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to admit. INTJs can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias – one that can cloud this personality type’s judgment.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Overly Critical: </b>These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their lives fail to match their level of restraint, INTJs can appear scathingly critical. But this criticism can be unfair – based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature.<br><br><b>4. Combative: </b>People with this personality type hate blindly following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. INTJs can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations – but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Socially Clueless: </b>INTJs’ relentless rationality can lead to frustration in their social lives. Their efforts to defy expectations may leave them feeling isolated or disconnected from other people. At times, these personalities may become cynical about the value of relationships altogether, questioning the importance of love and connection.",
            ],
            "Romantic Relationships" => [
                "People with the INTJ personality type (Architects) approach romance the way they do most challenges: strategically, with clear goals and a plan for achieving them. In a purely rational world, this approach would be foolproof, but matters of love are rarely rational. Consequently, they are at risk of overlooking or misinterpreting the unpredictability of human nature and affection. For these personalities, finding a compatible partner can be a particular challenge. Being innately logical, INTJs seek not just companionship but also intellectual stimulation from their partner – an uncommon quest offering its own unique rewards and challenges. Moreover, they are rarely satisfied. They can’t help but imagine how the world could be better than it already is – and they often bring this same mindset to the realm of love. Unfortunately, if they apply a relentlessly critical eye to every potential partner, people with the INTJ personality type may find themselves constantly dissatisfied.",
                "<b>The Woes of Dating:</b> INTJs value depth, intelligence, and unmitigated honesty. For them, a relationship that isn’t founded on these values simply isn’t worth pursuing. They would much rather stay single than force a false connection just for the sake of being with someone. It might not come as a surprise, then, that the unspoken rules and social niceties of the dating world can seem useless or even insulting to these personalities. The good news is that INTJs’ honesty and refusal to play games can be a breath of fresh air when it comes to dating. The bad news? Many romantic conventions exist for a reason – often because they make people feel comfortable or special or intrigued. And when people with this personality type refuse to play along, they may find dating difficult, if not impossible.",
                "As they mature and gain experience, many people with the INTJ personality type eventually come to understand the purpose of romantic rituals. Until that point, however, they may decide that dating is too irrational or beneath them. Some INTJs might claim to be above the “silliness” of dating in an effort to demonstrate their intellectual superiority. Obviously, this mindset is unlikely to help these personalities find or connect with a partner. Sometimes the best strategy for someone with this personality type is to focus on what they enjoy rather than struggle against the rules of dating. INTJs are often most attractive when they aren’t caught up in trying to be something they are not. Just doing what they do best – pursuing the interests that light them up – can help them connect with like-minded people and find a potential partner.",
                "<b>Emotional Sickness:</b> The INTJ personality type isn’t known for conventional shows of romance, such as sending flowers or writing mushy notes. Most people with this type spend more time thinking about love than expressing it. But when they believe that a relationship has potential, INTJs are more than capable of giving it their all, even if that takes them out of their comfort zone. And a healthy, long-term relationship is pretty much guaranteed to take these personalities out of their comfort zone at some point. In particular, emotions can feel like a second language. When their partner shares strong feelings, INTJs often default to shutting down or to analyzing the situation rather than simply listening and offering support. And when it’s time for them to share the inner workings of their own heart, INTJs may feel uncomfortable and exposed. For these personalities, becoming comfortable with their partner’s emotions – and their own – can take more than a little practice. Love is rarely easy, but it’s a challenge that can help people with the INTJ personality type grow. Through their relationships, they can learn to focus on the present, get in touch with their emotions, remain involved with other people, and stay open to things that they’re not used to. For a personality type so intent on self-development, these opportunities can make love even more satisfying."
            ],
            "Friendships" => [
                "Sharp-witted and darkly funny, people with the INTJ personality type (Architects) aren’t everyone’s cup of tea – and they’re okay with that. For the most part, they don’t really care about being considered “cool.” And they don’t spend their time and energy on just anyone. Instead, these personalities save themselves for friends who can match their intellectual curiosity and keep pace with their fast-moving mind. INTJs might have a reputation for being difficult to get to know, but it would be a mistake to label this personality type as antisocial or unfriendly. They do enjoy the pleasure of their own company and their own mind, but they also crave meaningful connections with friends. In fact, few things are more exhilarating to INTJ personalities than the spark that they feel when they’re immersed in conversation with someone who really gets them.",
                "<b>An Intellectual Match: </b>It’s not always easy to befriend someone with this personality type. These individuals have little patience for social rules or expectations, and they’d rather spend time alone than with someone who bores or irritates them. INTJs tend to have a clear idea of what they expect from their social lives and their friends, and they don’t want to waste too much time on anyone who doesn’t seem to meet these expectations. From the outside, this might sound dismissive, but the truth is that many INTJs have a knack for finding friends in seemingly unlikely places. These personalities aren’t particularly swayed by appearances or social status, so they aren’t afraid to befriend people who might be thought of as “outsiders” by the mainstream. In sizing up a potential friend, INTJs don’t particularly care how popular that person is – instead, they consider whether that person has values that are compatible with their own, such as intellect, honesty, self-improvement, or simply a different perspective. In friendship, INTJ personalities are looking for an intellectual match as much as anything else. They crave mental stimulation, and they tend to have the most fun among friends who can challenge their ideas, expose them to new concepts, and steer conversations in unexpected directions.",
                "<b>A Unique Friendship: </b>In their friendships, as in other aspects of their lives, INTJs prize independence. Social obligations can feel stifling to people with this personality type. They don’t want to feel beholden to their friends, and they don’t want their friends to feel beholden to them. For INTJs, an ideal friendship is low maintenance, low drama, and based on true enjoyment of each other’s company rather than obligation. INTJ personalities are fiercely loyal and go out of their way to help the people they appreciate and respect. They will willingly offer their unparalleled problem-solving ability in service of a friend’s challenges, assisting not just with comforting reassurances but actionable, logical solutions and carefully crafted strategies. However, it’s essential to note that while INTJs are willing to help, they can be inadvertently dismissive of emotional troubles that defy rational solutions.",
                "When sensitive or emotional situations arise, INTJs may feel out of their depth. These personalities are used to feeling knowledgeable and capable, so this sudden cluelessness can be disorienting for them. Many people with this type have to practice listening to their friends in a nonjudgmental, supportive way rather than jumping in immediately with solutions and advice. The good news is that, among friends they know and respect, INTJ personalities have no trouble relaxing and being themselves. Their sarcasm and witty banter may not be for everyone – especially people who struggle to read between the lines. But INTJs reward their true friends with candor and insight, along with an endless supply of fascinating stories, ideas, and conversations."
            ],
            "Parenthood" => [
                "People with the INTJ personality type (Architects) are known for their rationality and self-control, and they may be bemused by anyone who doesn’t share these strengths – for example, children. For this type, parenting often requires mastering new skills and developing cognitive flexibility. Fortunately, INTJ personalities are pretty much always up for a challenge – and for those who have children, parenthood can be an especially meaningful challenge to take on. As parents, INTJs often approach the role with a sense of seriousness and commitment. They see themselves not just as caregivers but also as invaluable guides responsible for helping shape their children’s intellect, enforcing discipline, and stimulating their natural curiosity.",
                "<b>An Honest Connection: </b>INTJ personalities want their children to grow up to be capable and self-reliant, with clear interests and strong critical-thinking skills. Rather than enforcing pointless rules, parents with this personality type look for age-appropriate ways to foster their children’s independence. That’s not to say that they are lenient – far from it. INTJs expect their children to use their freedom responsibly, and they aren’t the kind of parents who feel bad if they have to tell their kids no. Some personality types might shelter their children from difficult subjects, but INTJ parents believe that knowledge is far better than ignorance. For them, candor is a way of showing respect, and shielding their children from reality would be a disservice. Of course, the success of this approach depends on these parents’ ability to correctly gauge their children’s readiness for these hard truths.",
                "<b>The Chaos of Emotion: </b>Compared to many other personality types, INTJs aren’t especially comfortable with displays of affection. Showering someone with love and praise can feel unnatural to them – even if that “someone” is their own child. But children need cuddling and approval and other expressions of love, particularly during their younger years. As a result, INTJ parents may need to expand their emotional comfort zone in order to show their children just how much they are loved. Another challenge for parents with this personality type is offering emotional support. INTJ personalities take pride in being in command of their feelings, and they might (consciously or unconsciously) expect their children to be able to do the same. But this expectation isn’t reasonable – emotions may be confusing and, at times, chaotic, but they’re perfectly normal, and children need validation and support in order to navigate them.",
                "<b>Preparing for Life's Challenges: </b>INTJ parents try to make sure that their children are prepared to deal with anything that life throws at them. Parents with this personality type have a talent for reframing challenges as learning opportunities – and in doing so, they can inspire their children to develop their own style of rational thinking and problem-solving. Over time, INTJs’ children can apply these skills to increasingly complex situations, building their confidence as they grow. Every parent has a different dream for their child’s future. For INTJ personalities, the dream is to raise a competent adult who knows their own mind and solves their own problems. They understand that this can’t happen if they protect their children from every difficult or unpleasant thing in life. But their hope is that, if they give their children the right tools, they won’t have to."
            ],
            "Career Paths" => [
                "People with the INTJ personality type (Architects) are rarely satisfied by work that is too easy. They want a career that fires up their curiosity and leverages their intellect, allowing them to expand their prowess as they tackle meaningful challenges and problems. If a job’s description makes the average person think, “Wow, that sounds hard,” then it might just be a good fit for an INTJ.",
                "<b>The Early-Career Blues: </b>Starting at the bottom of the career ladder can be frustrating for people with this personality type. Early in their professional lives, they may be saddled with easy, routine tasks that bore them half to death. INTJs brim with creative and outside-the-box ideas. But with their disdain for schmoozing and workplace politics, they may struggle to earn the favor of their bosses and colleagues. The good news is that, over time, many INTJs develop their abilities into a track record so good that it can’t be ignored. Even when everyone around them falls prey to groupthink, people with this personality type can cut through the noise and figure out the true cause of a problem – and then fix it. As long as they don’t alienate their coworkers, these personalities can advance in their careers and gain the leverage that they need to see their ideas through.",
                "<b>Finding Their Place: </b>Some personality types are drawn to jobs that require nonstop teamwork and interaction, but INTJs tend to prefer positions that offer independence. By working alone or in small groups, they can make the most of their creativity without constant interruptions from curious coworkers or second-guessing supervisors. They really do believe that if they want something done right, they’d better do it themselves. The other side of that coin is that they have little respect for anyone who gets ahead based on networking or nepotism rather than merit. They believe that everyone should get their work done to the highest possible standards, and they generally believe that evidence, reason, and rationality should be the basis for all the important decisions made in the workplace. INTJs are not the ones to play favorites, jump to hasty conclusions, or act on impulses. Every move that they make is calculated and deeply thought out.",
                "<b>Ever Greater Challenges: </b>INTJ personalities demand progress and evolution, and they love to explore new ideas. As their careers progress, they may be drawn to positions that allow them to influence a company’s or organization’s overall strategies. Many INTJs pursue low profile but influential roles as project managers, systems engineers, marketing strategists, systems analysts, management consultants, and military strategists. People with this personality type tend to be happiest in careers that allow them to innovate and experiment in ways both large and small. It’s no surprise, then, that jobs in engineering, research, science, and technology are common choices for INTJs – but creative fields, from architecture to musical composition to video game design, can also gratify their innovative streak. And INTJs’ relentless desire to get to the bottom of things can lead them to careers as auditors, cybersecurity specialists, or business analysts.",
                "The truth is that people with the INTJ personality type can apply their strengths to just about any role. In a retail setting, for example, their insatiable curiosity might lead them to investigate what makes one front-of-store display more effective than another. Some careers with strong social components, such as sales or human resources, might not seem like obvious fits – but fortunately, INTJs know how to look beyond the obvious. Creative and visionary, INTJ personalities want to find a career that takes advantage of their unique gifts. Few personality types, if any, can match their ability to transform complex ideas into clear, actionable strategies. These individuals know how much they can offer the world through their work – and their priority is to ensure that their position, whatever it may be, makes full use of their skills, knowledge, and intellect."
            ],
            "Workplace Habits" => [
                "Wherever they may be on the career ladder, people with the INTJ personality type (Architects) want to pursue their professional goals according to their own standards. And if any personality type has high standards for themselves, it’s almost certainly INTJs. They are innate problem-solvers who are always looking for better, more efficient ways to accomplish tasks. In theory, this attitude makes for a model employee and coworker. And in many ways, they are exactly that. But these personalities may be harsh or dismissive toward coworkers they don’t respect – and unfortunately, losing their respect can be all too easy. In particular, INTJs may struggle to work with colleagues who prioritize convenience over innovation or socializing over success.",
                "<b>INTJ Subordinates: </b>People with the INTJ personality type are known for their independence. They are not at all shy about taking initiative, correcting errors, or making improvements even to the most minor elements of a work project. Their worst nightmare would be a micromanaging boss who monopolizes their time with pointless meetings, insists on useless rules, or appraises employees’ performance based on how likable they seem rather than their actual merits. Titles mean little to someone with the INTJ personality type, and they often struggle to defer to a manager they consider less intelligent than themselves. They might find it difficult to restrain themselves from offering their bosses feedback and criticism – an approach that, depending on the boss, can backfire. In the real world, not all bosses will be as logical or open-minded as INTJs might prefer. But that doesn’t mean that these personalities should allow a less-than-ideal manager to hold them back. INTJs can use their creativity and ingenuity to expand their responsibilities and develop their expertise – even if they don’t have the independence that they crave. To do this, these personalities may need to prioritize building a productive and respectful relationship with their manager, no matter how far from perfect that person may be.",
                "<b>INTJ Colleagues: </b>Few INTJs choose jobs that require constant teamwork or social interaction. To these individuals, most team-building techniques and group meetings are a waste of time. And chitchat, gossip, and office politics – well, those can be nothing short of workplace plagues. Even a brainstorming session, normally a delight for these sharp personalities, can become tedious if it just goes in circles without leading to clear action. Fortunately, their determination and focus often enable people with this personality type to produce effective results, even without the help of others. That’s not to say that INTJs can’t work with others – in fact, they may achieve some of their greatest successes this way. Relentlessly curious and capable, they can make for excellent collaborators. These personalities may never enjoy pairing up with just anyone, but if they look more closely, they often find that many of their coworkers deserve their respect. And in the company of trusted colleagues, INTJs’ brainstorming sessions can become even more electric.",
                "<b>INTJ Managers: </b>Though they may be surprised to hear it, INTJs can make great leaders. With their strategic mindsets, these personalities habitually orchestrate and administrate their tasks to perfection. Additionally, they rarely throw around their authority just to prove that they’re in charge. Instead, they look for ways to promote innovation and effectiveness – even if that means breaking with established hierarchies. Generally speaking, INTJs prefer to treat those who work for them as equals. Rather than micromanaging, these personalities aim to direct broader strategies while letting other people handle day-to-day activities. That’s not to say they’re completely hands-off, however. INTJ bosses want to know exactly what’s going on and when, and they’re always ready to sit down and go over every tiny detail with their employees. INTJ managers respect and reward proactive behavior, delegating responsibilities to employees with the strongest critical-thinking skills. But this independence isn’t just granted – it’s required. Employees who struggle to direct themselves – who just want to be told what to do – may have a hard time meeting these managers’ standards. And anyone who tries to cover up bad results with flattery or excuses is likely to be disappointed, as those strategies almost never fool people with this personality type."

                "Armed with powerful intellects and strategic minds, people with the INTJ personality type (Architects) can outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. But these strengths, when misunderstood, can turn into weaknesses – and keep them from reaching their full potential.<br><br>In reading through this personality profile, you probably hit a tipping point. You went from that trademark INTJ skepticism to “Huh…” to “Wait, what?” You might even be a little uncomfortable, because you’re not used to being understood, even by the people closest to you.<br><br>Chances are you’ve accepted this as part of who you are, and maybe you’ve even grown proud of it. But embracing that disconnect isn’t a requirement for INTJs. It’s a misused defense mechanism that can lead you down a lonely, inefficient path. Gaining insight into yourself and others is so much more rewarding – and effective."

                "People with the <b>INTP personality type</b> (Logicians) pride themselves on their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been INTPs. People with this personality type tend to prefer solitude, as they can easily become immersed in their thoughts when they are left to their own devices. They are also incredibly creative and inventive, and they are not afraid to express their novel ways of thinking or to stand out from the crowd.",
                "<b>The Life of the Maid: </b>INTP personalities often lose themselves in thought – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People with this personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, their mind buzzes with ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads. And it’s not uncommon for them to drift off during conversations. Their mind simply executes a detour to uncharted territories of thought where new ideas are constantly being born. From the outside, INTPs may seem to live in a never-ending daydream. They have a reputation for being pensive, detached, and a bit reserved. That is, until they actively try to direct all of their mental energy on the moment or the person at hand. But regardless of which mode they’re in, INTPs are Introverts and tend to get tired out by extensive socializing. After a long day, they crave time alone to consult their own thoughts. INTPs cherish their independence and often find themselves most productive during the late evening hours when distractions are kept to a minimum. Even so, it would be a mistake to think that these personalities are unfriendly or uptight. When they connect with someone who can match their mental energy, INTPs absolutely light up, leaping from one thought to another. Few things energize them like the opportunity to swap ideas or enjoy a lively debate with another curious, inquiring soul.",
                "<b>Elementary, My Dear Logician: </b>People with the INTP personality type love to analyze patterns. Without necessarily knowing how they do it, they often have a Sherlock Holmes-like knack for spotting discrepancies and irregularities. In other words, it might be a bad idea to lie to someone with this type. Ironically, they shouldn’t always be held at their word. INTPs rarely mean to be dishonest, but with their active mind, they sometimes overflow with ideas and theories that they haven’t thought through all the way. These personalities may change their mind on anything from their weekend plans to a fundamental moral principle without ever realizing that they’d appeared to have made up their mind in the first place. In addition, they are often happy to play devil’s advocate in order to keep an interesting discussion humming along. INTPs could spend all day musing about ideas and possibilities – and they often do. That said, the practical, everyday work of turning those ideas into reality doesn’t always hold their interest. Fortunately, when it comes to dissecting a tricky, multilayered problem and coming up with a creative solution, few personality types can match INTPs’ creative genius and potential.</b>",
                "<b>Mysteries of the Universe: </b>People with this personality type want to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. As their name suggests, INTPs (a.k.a Logicians) feel most at home in the realm of logic and rationality. As a result, they can find themselves baffled by the illogical, irrational ways that feelings and emotions influence people’s behavior – including their own. This doesn’t mean that INTPs are unfeeling. These personalities generally want to offer emotional support to their friends and loved ones, but they don’t necessarily know how. And because they can’t decide on the best, most efficient way to offer support, they may hold off on doing or saying anything at all. This “analysis paralysis” can affect multiple areas of INTPs’ lives. People with this personality type can overthink even the smallest of decisions. This sometimes makes them feel ineffective and stuck, so exhausted by the endless parade of thoughts in their mind that they struggle to get things done. The good news is that they don’t have to stay stuck for long. Their unique strengths include everything that they need to pull themselves out of the ruts that they occasionally fall into. By leveraging their creativity and their open-mindedness, people with the INTP personality type can reach their full potential – both as thinkers and as happy, well-rounded people."

This gives them a knack for spotting unexpected patterns and connections that other personalities might overlook.<br><br><b>2. Original: </b>Thanks to their unrelenting imagination, these personalities can come up with creative, counterintuitive ideas that wouldn’t occur to most people. Not all of these ideas are feasible, of course, but INTPs’ willingness to think outside the box can produce remarkable innovations.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Open-Minded: </b>INTPs are driven by curiosity and an intense desire to learn. As they learn, they’re rarely afraid to shift their perspective – even in matters of politics, religion, and philosophy. People with this personality type tend to be receptive to new ideas, as long as those ideas are something that they connect with on an intellectual level.<br><br><b>4. Curious: </b>These personalities are always casting about for new things to learn about. One week, they might be obsessed with geophysics, and the next, they might lose themselves in videos about guitar building. When inspiration strikes, INTPs go all in on their newfound interest, learning everything that they can.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Honest: </b>INTPs care about the truth. Rather than taking comfort in ideology or received ideas, they want to understand what’s really going on beneath the surface of things. As a result, they can be relied upon to combat bias and misinformation even when it isn’t easy to do so – and they expect other people to be honest with them in return.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Disconnected: </b>INTP personalities can get lost in their own train of thought even when they’re with other people. After finally resurfacing with something to say, they may find that the conversation has moved on without them. This can cause people with this personality type to feel disconnected from others, especially in large social gatherings.<br><br><b>2. Insensitive: </b>INTPs see rationality as the key to a better, happier world. At times, they may underestimate the importance of such irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition.

INTPs are constantly on the lookout for problems to solve, topics to learn, and new ways to approach things. Taken too far, this mindset can become overwhelming, with these personalities constantly trying to reinvent the wheel rather than reliably addressing their needs and responsibilities.<br><br><b>4. Overthinkers: </b>INTPs’ minds are ceaselessly active, toiling away even when they’re not consciously thinking. While their rapid-fire thoughts can be beneficial at times, they can also cause them to overthink and fall prey to analysis paralysis. When this occurs, INTPs can struggle to reach a decision or take action because they’re too caught up in considering every possible outcome or angle.",

When it comes to explaining their rationale, however, they aren’t always patient. If their conversation partner doesn’t follow along or seem sufficiently interested, they may give up with a dismissive “never mind.”",

INTPs may seem cerebral and reserved, but once they let their guard down, they have a playful, creative side as well. As Introverts, INTPs appreciate alone time, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t crave companionship. For people with this personality type, the ideal romantic partner isn’t just someone to pass the time with but an equal who can challenge their ideas. They want to spend their life in pursuit of learning and growth. They hope that the person they love will not just share this mission but also actively encourage it. Finding a relationship that meets these standards isn’t always easy for these personalities. INTPs may drag their feet when it comes to going out into the world and meeting new people. And even when they do have an interest in someone, it can take them a while to work up the will to risk rejection and ask that person out. Being the center of attention in an emotionally delicate situation isn’t easy for anyone, but especially not for INTPs.",
                "<b>A Genuine Connection: </b>Navigating the world of romance can be a puzzling and unpredictable endeavor for people with this personality type. INTP personalities approach their romantic relationships much like they approach intellectual problems – with analysis, curiosity, and a desire to understand the underlying mechanisms. For them, a partner is not just a romantic interest but also a fascinating subject of study, an enigma full of complexities waiting to be unraveled. INTPs take their romantic relationships seriously, but they don’t tend to stress about traditional labels and other dating formalities. When they finally meet a partner who they connect with on a real level – someone whose mind they respect and whose company they enjoy – these personalities move forward at their own pace and in their own unique style. Even early in the dating phase, INTPs are unusually direct and honest. They don’t see the point of playing games, and while they can be quiet, they aren’t coy. People with this personality type rarely filter their opinions, and they encourage their partner to be frank with them as well. For many of these individuals, being up front isn’t a sign of rudeness or bad manners – instead, it’s a point of pride, not to mention a way to avoid misunderstandings.",
                "As their relationships progress, their daily needs prove simple. Gifts, surprises, complex social plans, and elaborate date nights are all fairly unimportant to INTPs. Unfortunately, if their partner does want these things, it may not even occur to people with this type to plan them out. These personalities may need to put special effort and attention into learning how to express their affection in a way that resonates with their significant other. Otherwise, their partner may feel ignored, underappreciated, or even unloved. On the plus side, INTPs can turn this situation into an opportunity to put their trademark ingenuity to good use.",
                "<b>Navigating Conflict: </b>Few people love conflict, but INTPs are especially prone to shutting down when emotional disagreements arise. Rather than slowing down and really listening, they may use their powers of logic to try to prove their partner wrong. Alternatively, they might offer easy, rational solutions, not wanting to delve into the messiness of deeper issues and feelings. As they mature, INTPs often learn that people’s emotional needs (including their own) are real and valid. For a personality type that loves rationality, this isn’t always the easiest of lessons. But this awareness can help them rise to the challenges that all long-term relationships encounter. Talking about feelings may not come naturally to them, but these personalities can learn to find emotional common ground with their partner, even in moments of disagreement.",
                "<b>The Irrationality of Joy: </b>People with the INTP personality type tend to live in a world of thought. Romantic relationships can help break them out of their own mind, allowing them to experience the fullness of joy and pleasure in the present moment. This experience can be transformational, revealing strengths, traits, and desires that they hadn’t known lay within them. With their creative, vivid imagination, INTP personalities can make for surprisingly enthusiastic and passionate partners, capable of expanding their horizons in ways that serve their relationship without ever losing their sense of self."

Not everyone will meet their standards for a potential friend, but when someone does, the connection can spark instantly, surprising everyone who thought they had this seemingly distant personality type pegged.",
                "<b>Choosy or Selective?: </b>Perhaps because they don’t mind the company of their own thoughts, they don’t surround themselves with people just for the sake of it. As a result, it’s not always easy to become close friends with these personalities. But when INTPs do open up, they can be lively, imaginative friends who always have something interesting or unexpected to say. INTPs’ best friends tend to share their passion for new ideas, riddles, and solutions. But that doesn’t mean that people with this personality type only seek out friends who agree with them. INTPs don’t mind having their ideas challenged – in fact, they have a great deal of respect for people who make them rethink their assumptions and keep them on their toes. INTP friendships are knowledge based, buoyed by the exchange of ideas, theories, and concepts. To this personality type, there’s nothing more exhilarating than a mind-bending conversation that stretches till the wee hours of the morning. People who aren’t able to keep up or who have sharply differing tastes (don’t talk to them about celebrities) may find themselves feeling ignored or brushed off. These friends reserve conversation for topics that they find meaningful or for people they already like enough to stick it out.</b>",
                "<b>The Meaning of Friendship: </b>When friends come to them with problems and dilemmas, INTPs are generally excited to help. These personalities can be counted on to offer logical advice and rational solutions, turning even the messiest of situations into a pros and cons list. But when it comes to emotional support or matters of the heart, people with this personality type may feel a bit out of their depth. For INTPs, one of the greatest (and most difficult) lessons of friendship is that sometimes people don’t need advice on how to solve their problems – they just need someone they can count on to be by their side. With INTPs, friends can expect thought-provoking conversations, uninhibited honesty, and unique perspectives on a wide variety of topics. Their friendships, though few, are deeply cherished and cultivated with a lot of thought and care. People with the INTP personality type have an uncanny ability to see past superficial trappings, such as social status or how someone dresses, and appreciate the full potential of the person inside. In a world obsessed with fitting in, these individuals can inspire their friends to buck convention, ignore trends, and find their unique voices."

At times, they may be baffled by their children’s messy, irrational, and ever-changing – but completely natural – emotions. After all, children have yet to develop the sort of agency and logic that INTPs take for granted. Still, parenthood can be extremely meaningful. Tolerant and open minded, INTP personalities encourage their children to think independently, seek out new knowledge, and voice and defend their own opinions. They view the experience as a dynamic avenue of learning through which they are not just imparting wisdom but also continuously gaining insight from the process.",
                "<b>To Thine Own Self Be True: </b>Parents with the INTP personality type usually don’t fret too much about social expectations. In other words, they rarely obsess over parenting advice or other people’s ideas of how their children should behave. They’re also unlikely to push their children toward a traditional life of school > career > marriage > house > kids > retirement (and in that order, thank you very much). This isn’t to say that INTP parents don’t have expectations of their children – they do. These personalities expect their children to be self-motivated and independent. They hope that, when their children are old enough, they’ll have the critical-thinking abilities necessary to decide on their own life path and figure out how to go after it.",
                "<b>The Gift of Freedom: </b>People with the INTP personality type encourage their children’s curiosity, giving them the freedom to acquire knowledge and expand their horizons. These parents generally take a relaxed, intellectual approach toward their children. Rather than imposing needless rules or strict schedules, they aim to create a home environment that encourages exploration and independence. INTPs also greatly value the intellectual growth of their children. They encourage their children to be independent thinkers and to question everything. These parents are more likely to respond to a child’s query with a “What do you think?” rather than providing direct answers.</b>",
                "For INTP personalities, honoring their children’s independence is a sign of respect. But for many children (and even young adults), this level of personal freedom can be daunting. If their home life doesn’t include reasonable boundaries and parental guidance, these children may find themselves unfocused or adrift, convinced that they need to figure out the world on their own – a tall order indeed. Fortunately, INTPs have the mental flexibility to understand that they can encourage their children’s independence without being too hands-off. Parents with this personality type can reestablish balance by making sure that they’re available to offer advice and support whenever their children need it. They can also set clear, common-sense boundaries and establish reasonable consequences for bad behavior so that their children can navigate daily life without relying entirely on their own burgeoning self-control.",
                "<b>A Worthy Challenge: </b>Offering emotional support may not be easy for INTP parents – in fact, along with establishing rules and boundaries, it may be among their greatest challenges. The good news is that these personalities are more than capable of meeting this challenge, although it can take some effort. INTPs want to empower their children to solve their own problems and meet their own needs. This is a worthy goal, but children need a steady foundation of validation and support – along with the aforementioned rules and boundaries – before they can tackle the world on their own. To help create this foundation, these parents need to express the love, affection, and admiration that they feel for their children. INTPs want nothing more than for their children to grow up smart and independent. As long as parents with this personality type teach empathy alongside rationality, their children can grow into confident adults who know how to ask questions, use their minds, and take care of themselves no matter what comes their way."

They are quirky personalities with unique perspectives on the world, and few work environments are designed with them in mind. But with a little ingenuity, INTPs can find work that takes full advantage of their strengths – including creativity, a passion for ideas, and an innovative spirit. These qualities, like so many things about this personality type, are rare. As a result, they can – with a little effort – find ways to stand out in a wide range of fields.",

They find themselves drawn to the realms of theories and ideas, eager to delve beneath the surface of everyday life and investigate the mysteries of the universe. With their curious spirits, these individuals can find the beauty in concepts that might make others’ eyes glaze over. The INTP personality type is well represented among mathematicians, analysts, researchers, and scientists, particularly in more abstract fields such as physics. Jobs in engineering and technology can also be a match, especially if they allow room for creativity – INTPs would much rather pioneer new approaches than spend their days implementing someone else’s work. That said, the best jobs for these personalities aren’t limited to technical fields. INTPs’ talent for analysis and research can be invaluable in pretty much any line of work – and they have the flexibility to shine even in careers that might not seem like an obvious match. Any job that allows these individuals to invent or experiment with new processes – from teaching to management to merchandising – can give them endless gratification.",
                "<b>Deeper Motivations: </b>At times, these personalities may be difficult for their colleagues to understand. Unlike many personality types, INTPs aren’t motivated by a desire to impress their boss, be accepted by their coworkers, or get a fancy new job title. In fact, they’re often turned off by things that motivate other workers, such as team-building exercises, watercooler chitchat, check-in meetings, or motivational speeches from managers. Instead, people with this personality type are driven by their own curiosity and their own high standards for themselves. For INTPs, “good enough” is rarely good enough, and they’d hate to be called average or (even worse) mediocre. But they aren’t hardworking just for the sake of it, and not every task captures their attention equally. At times, these personalities might ignore routine or administrative work in favor of pursuits that they consider more engaging or important.",
                "Few things frustrate these personalities more than dealing with overbearing bosses or waiting around for other people’s input. As a result, INTPs typically shy away from heavily structured, rigid environments or jobs that require a lot of social interaction or strict adherence to hierarchy. They prefer to work on their own terms. Consequently, laboratories can be an excellent match for someone with this personality type, as can pretty much any environment that allows them to carry out tasks and explore ideas without too many people looking over their shoulder. Alternatively, many INTPs maintain a sense of flexibility and independence by going the self-employed route, offering their services as consultants and freelancers.",
                "<b>Social Cues: </b>Nearly every job posting these days requests candidates with strong people skills. INTPs might argue that people skills are overrated – and given how many fields are being revolutionized by AI, data, and automation, they may have a point. Increasingly, employers need people like INTPs who can understand complex systems and think critically. Where INTPs rarely thrive is in workplaces that require them to provide a high degree of emotional satisfaction. That said, people with this personality type are nothing if not adaptable, and they can absolutely succeed in people-oriented positions. In these roles, they may need to keep their mind engaged by experimenting with new, more effective ways of serving their customers. If people with this personality type tell themselves that they can’t handle jobs with a social element, then they’re selling themselves short. As problem-solvers and forward thinkers, they are invaluable in any roles where clear, innovative thinking is needed. So long as INTP personalities manage to smile and shake hands just long enough to prove their skills, they often find that their incisiveness and creativity are in high demand."

INTPs crave intellectual stimulation, freedom to pursue their ideas, and opportunities to solve challenging puzzles. And if they can fulfill these needs with minimal social obligations and humdrum administrative tasks, even better! Though some people with this personality type may scoff at the notion, they often do their best work in collaboration with others. INTPs tend to live in their heads, coming up with thoughts and insights faster than they know what to do with them. They may sometimes feel irritated when managers or coworkers force them to slow down and figure out how to implement their ideas – but in the long term, such colleagues can be the secret to INTPs’ success.",
                "<b>INTP Subordinates: </b>Under the right conditions, INTP employees are innovative and resourceful, easily wrapping their mind around whatever complex problems are placed in front of them. Their distinct ability to immerse themselves in tasks and their knack for conceptualizing innovative solutions can make them invaluable assets to their workplace. However, their preference for solitary work and their sometimes forgetfulness of routine tasks or details can occasionally be seen as a drawback. INTPs are often tempted to put off tasks that seem boring or beneath them, but until they “pay their dues” by doing these tasks, their bosses probably won’t grant them the freedom and latitude that they crave. Although people with this personality type might wish that they could just skip ahead to the interesting stuff, they need to prove themselves to their managers first. There’s good news, though: Their time at the bottom of the job ladder can actually help them build new skills and habits that will help them succeed later on. These personalities have many strengths, but completing projects doesn’t tend to be one of them. INTPs can chafe at the oversight and limitations that they encounter early in their careers – or they can use the additional accountability and structure to their advantage, learning to become more effective at turning their ideas into reality.",
                "<b>INTP Colleagues: </b>At times, INTPs may see their colleagues not as a group of people to socialize and work with but rather as a series of potential distractions who sometimes provide useful knowledge. This isn’t to say that these personalities never enjoy their coworkers’ company, but the prospect of watercooler chitchat isn’t going to get them out of bed in the morning. That said, they can benefit from their colleagues more than they might realize. By surrounding themselves with people who challenge them, INTP personalities can make sure that they’re actually doing their best work. And although they aren’t exactly social butterflies, they often find that the workday goes by a little faster when they have a chance to bounce their ideas off of coworkers they respect. INTPs who build positive relationships are more likely to get asked to contribute their ideas and expertise to new projects. If they want to stay on the cutting edge of the most interesting new things happening at their workplace, these personalities would do well to establish themselves as helpful collaborators, not lone wolves.",
                "<b>INTP Managers: </b>INTPs generally don’t care about having power over others, but they often enjoy management positions. When they’re in charge, people with this personality type can delegate the administrative tasks that make their eyes glaze over and focus on the good stuff: coming up with new ideas. As managers, INTPs tend to be tolerant and flexible. They’re open to suggestions (as long as those suggestions are logical, of course), and they allow their employees a fair amount of freedom. But this freedom comes at a cost – INTP managers have high standards, and they expect others to grasp their insights instantly and provide their own in equal measure. Bosses with this personality type can have a reputation for being exacting. They quickly pick up on discrepancies in their employees’ work, and they may not hold back when it comes to doling out negative feedback. As they gain experience, INTP managers often discover that balancing criticism with praise and encouragement allows their team to enjoy higher morale – and, just as importantly, better results."

Embodying the gifts of charisma and confidence, ENTJs project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, these personalities are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination, and sharp mind to achieve whatever objectives they’ve set for themselves. Their intensity might sometimes rub people the wrong way, but ultimately, ENTJs take pride in both their work ethic and their impressive level of self-discipline.",
                "<b>Striving for Greatness: </b>If there’s anything that people with this personality type love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that, given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes ENTJs brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as ENTJ personalities push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.",
                "At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, ENTJs are dominant, unforgiving, and unyielding. This isn’t because they are coldhearted or vicious per se – it’s more that these personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, and the repartee that comes from this environment. If the other side can’t keep up, that’s no reason for them to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory. ENTJs respect those who can match them intellectually and also display precision and quality in their actions, equal to their own. These personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone). However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others’ failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where they really start to run into trouble.",
                "<b>A Worthy Challenge: </b>Emotional expression isn’t the strong suit of any Analyst (NT) type, but ENTJs’ distance from their emotions is especially public and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, these personalities may inadvertently overlook the emotional sensitivity of individuals who they perceive as inefficient or lazy. To people with this personality type, emotional displays are generally displays of weakness, and it’s easy to make enemies with this approach – ENTJs will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals but for their validation and feedback as well, something that they are, curiously, very sensitive to. ENTJ personalities are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life – and often enough they are. They need to remember, though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions but from the actions of the team that props them up. It’s important for them to recognize the contributions, talents, and needs of their support network – especially from an emotional standpoint. Even if they have to adopt a “fake it ‘til you make it” mentality, if people with the ENTJ personality type are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories that they can handle."

They will root out such behavior wherever they go.<br><br><b>2. Energetic: </b>ENTJ personalities approach their responsibilities with vigor and drive. This is not a type to shy away from busy schedules or complex challenges. In fact, the more they are able to accomplish throughout the day, the more energized they feel, and they will happily share this infectious enthusiasm for productivity with the people around them.",

                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Impatient: </b>Some people need more time to think than others – an intolerable delay to quick-thinking ENTJ personalities. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste – a terrible mistake to make.<br><br><b>4. Arrogant: </b>ENTJs respect quick thoughts and firm convictions and may look down on those who don’t match up. This is a challenge for most other personality types, who are perhaps not timid in their own right but will seem so beside this sometimes overbearing type.",

People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.<br><br><b>6. Cold and Ruthless: </b>Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, make ENTJs fairly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational or irrelevant.",

These personalities are in it to win and will gladly take leading roles in relationships from the start, assuming personal responsibility for how smoothly things go and working actively to ensure a mutually rewarding experience. Romantic relationships are a serious business, and ENTJs are in it for the long haul.",
                "<b>Taking the Lead: </b>This sense of personal responsibility means that they put a lot of energy into their relationships, and they show their creativity by always having something new on the agenda to keep things interesting, especially in the dating phase. At the same time though, ENTJ personalities keep their eyes on the long term, and if they determine that a relationship is heading toward a dead end, they perhaps too easily cut their losses and move on in what will seem to their partner an abrupt end to the attention they had been receiving. This occasional ruthlessness with personal relationships is ENTJs’ primary weakness, and if these personalities aren’t careful, they can develop quite the reputation. Sensing others’ feelings and emotions will never be a comfortable skill for them, but it is critical that they work consciously to develop it, both for their partner’s sake and for their own healthy emotional expression. If they don’t, they risk dominating and overruling their partner, and this insensitivity can easily break a relationship, especially early on.",
                "<b>Loving Boldly: </b>But if all goes well in the dating phase and a future is deemed viable, people with the ENTJ personality type continue to impress with their creativity and energy. They are known to bring out the best in their partner, pushing them to achieve their dreams and aspirations. Their ambitious nature often fuels their partner’s ambitions as well, creating a power-couple dynamic. Being extremely growth-oriented themselves, ENTJs also love to improve and evolve in their relationships. They tend to listen to and act on their partner’s criticisms, so long as they are logical ones, and they are always striving to become the best version of themselves – for both their own good and the good of their partner. It can be surprising to these personalities – and perhaps bad news for their relationship – if their partner doesn’t share this desire to grow.",
                "That being said, people with this personality type would do well to remember that their approach is just one angle of a multifaceted spectrum of alternatives. While they may view criticism as the most efficient route (and they’re often right), they should bear in mind that their partner may be more interested in a more emotional form of support and growth, an area of self-improvement that ENTJs themselves too often avoid. Mature ENTJs are able to recognize and adapt to the needs of their partner and know that even the most rational individuals still have emotional needs that must be met. Fortunately, the same logic that dismisses emotions is also able to recognize that a conciliatory attitude can be the best tool to get the job done. With their strong senses of responsibility and dedication, people with the ENTJ personality type are sure to make this effort, resulting in long-lasting, satisfying relationships."

Friendships of circumstance, built on things like shared routines, are not this personality type’s preferred method. ENTJs prefer to seek out individuals who share their passion for deep, meaningful discussions and who enjoy learning and development as much as they do. It is not always easy to be friends with ENTJs, as they demand a lot from these relationships. But they pay a great deal of attention to their friendships and will work hard to make sure that they are fulfilling, inspiring, and, most of all, conduits for mutual self-improvement.",

Consequently, much of what they find enjoyable is the repartee of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every angle. People with the ENTJ personality type value intelligence and are highly critical. They won’t back down if they are put on the defensive – in fact, there’s no better way to earn their admiration. Many different kinds of people can form strong friendships with these bold personalities, although more sensitive personality types might struggle from time to time if their ENTJ friend places too much emphasis on what is rational instead of trying to understand how they might be feeling. This lack of sensitivity is one of these personalities’ greatest weaknesses. Their tendency to challenge their friends, question their conclusions, and dismiss emotional arguments as irrelevant may occasionally rub people the wrong way. However, once any problems are brought to their attention, people with the ENTJ personality type can be very curious about and open to trying to understand other people’s emotional perspectives.</b>",
                "<b>Bridging the Gap: </b>More enlightened ENTJs recognize that if there ever was an area where they could learn from others and improve themselves, it is in the realm of emotional sensitivity – to dismiss any aspect of personal growth borders on hypocrisy. Still, the bulk of their friends will likely share some passion for logical, far-reaching ideas and critical debate. "

But they must, at times, temper their strong-willed, hyper-logical approach to life in order to make room for their children’s needs and feelings as they help them grow. This is simply to say that their relationships with children, who are typically more sensitive and less able to conduct truly rational analysis, require much more emotional tact and personal liberty than ENTJs are accustomed to giving. But these resolute personalities are always up for a challenge. ENTJs take their roles as parents seriously and approach the task with the utmost sense of personal responsibility. Holding themselves to a higher standard than most, ENTJ parents see the success of their children as a reflection of those personal standards. They want nothing more than to see their kids grow into smart, independent people who strive to achieve their goals. Establishing specific moral values is less important to them than the cultivation of intellect and independent, rational thought.",

But even though they will gladly have rational, well-thought-out discussions, at the end of the day, people with this personality type expect their authority to be respected. A disagreement is no excuse for shirking established responsibilities. ENTJ parents can be uncompromising in maintaining both structure and discipline. From time to time, this strictness can be a source of tension in the household. It would benefit these parents to remember that a little flexibility can go a long way. That said, where ENTJ parents really run into trouble is when debates with their kids devolve into emotional appeals. Their weakness with emotional tolerance makes dealing with growing children a significant challenge. These personalities should strive to strengthen this skill, as young children don’t have the words to express their needs rationally, and adolescents often don’t have the patience for it.",
                "<b>Fostering Independence: </b>These parents can strive to remember that a part of developing that necessary sense of independence is being able to chart one’s own destiny.

This often helps their children move beyond assigned activities and into the longer goal of becoming capable and intelligent young adults who can direct themselves.",

No other personality type quite enjoys the hustle and grind of moving up the career ladder quite like they do. Their level of self-determination is unmatched. Combining their vision, intelligence, and willpower to push ideas through to completion no matter the obstacles, ENTJ personalities are a force to be reckoned with.",

They excel at keeping people on track and getting things done. Naturally, the careers that these driven personalities are often most drawn to make the fullest use of these qualities. Any position high enough that they can clearly see the horizon – like executive positions and careers in entrepreneurialism – tend to be valuable lines of work for people with this ambitious personality type. Structure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy or holds things back with incompetence, laziness, or inefficiency, these types may come down hard. ENTJ personalities pursue their goals with singular vision and have strict standards for themselves and others that are designed to be effective above all else. This makes ENTJs excellent corporate strategists, and their objectivity and clarity of thought make them respected lawyers and judges. ",

Fortunately, ENTJ personalities are often clear and concise communicators, especially in person, making business administration a comfortable fit – so long as their tasks don’t stray too far into routine maintenance and upkeep. ENTJs also have a thirst for knowledge, and they aren’t afraid to use a principle once they’ve grasped its underlying mechanisms. Combining this with their leadership makes these personalities trying, but effective, university professors.",
                "<b>Great Expectations: </b>The only problem is that it takes time for their skills to be recognized, and stagnating as low-level employees will have them bouncing off the walls and feeling deeply unhappy. People with the ENTJ personality type crave responsibility, growth, and opportunity, and they genuinely enjoy managing others to get a job done. These personalities are visionaries and leaders, not grunts or day-to-day administrators – at least in their own eyes.

ENTJs’ efficiency and clear communication are valued, their leadership is admired, and their ability to simply get things done is unrivaled. That being said, some situations are more appropriate for these bold personalities than others, as they prefer having the freedom to get their work done in a way that makes sense to them without being micromanaged. This can make work in any lower positions where they do not have personal autonomy a big challenge.",
                "<b>ENTJ Subordinates: </b>Subordinate positions can be challenging for these personalities, and it takes active management to ensure their satisfaction and engagement. Ever the high achievers, ENTJ subordinates set out to learn new skills and to seek out new challenges and responsibilities, eager to prove that nothing is impossible with a little hard work. If things get a little slow, they may make an effort to create work and make unnecessary changes, but when they feel involved in the projects around them, they prove well organized and well prioritized. People with the ENTJ personality type hold themselves to very high standards, but a lot of what sets this tone is feedback from their environment – namely, criticism from their managers. Objective, rational statements about what is done right and what can be done better are helpful to this learning-oriented type, and far from resenting such criticisms, they appreciate them. Opportunities for growth keep ENTJ personalities engaged and productive, and so long as their managers recognize this as their primary responsibility, it will very likely be a fruitful and satisfying relationship.",
                "<b>ENTJ Colleagues: </b>Among colleagues, ENTJs are sociable and greatly enjoy sharing ideas and critiques in their frequent brainstorming sessions. These ambitious personalities tend to insert themselves into positions of power in the workplace, considering their objectivity and charisma the perfect qualities for these roles. They will be the first to volunteer to lead a project or represent the team. But even though they love to be at the helm of the ship, people with the ENTJ personality type also enjoy working with those who have demonstrated that they too share a strong work ethic. On the other hand, anyone who they view as being less competent or driven will likely be met with a skeptical attitude. ENTJ personalities are strong-willed, even dominant, and though they enjoy inspiring and tutoring others, the energy that they bring to the process can sometimes seem overbearing. When these roles are reversed, their mentors should bear in mind that their students are very rational and respect firm confidence – hand-holding, emotional appeals, or wavering indecision will likely weaken their ties.",
                "<b>ENTJ Managers: </b>ENTJ managers are confident, charismatic communicators, and they communicate just one vision: to get the job done as efficiently as possible and to the highest standard of quality. All else is subordinate to that objective. And as the astute individuals that they are, people with the ENTJ personality type have an innate ability to identify the strengths of each member of their team and incorporate those abilities into their plan so that each individual fills a unique and important role. While these efforts often boost morale and satisfaction among their like-minded subordinates, they are still crafted to achieve that ultimate goal of timely and exceptional work. Those who are seen as inefficient by their ENTJ managers or who demonstrate themselves to be lazy or to produce shoddy work will know in no uncertain terms of their failure to impress. That being said, these dedicated personalities don’t easily give up on any of their team members. They will work tirelessly to ensure that everyone can succeed in the responsibilities that they’ve been given, even if it means putting in some extra hours to get to the heart of any problem."

At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the ENTJ personality type.<BR><BR>At some point in reading through your results, you probably hit a tipping point.

            "Introduction" => [
                "Quick-witted and audacious, people with the <B>ENTP personality type</B> (Debaters) aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up these personalities more than a bit of verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better. It would be a mistake, though, to think of ENTPs as disagreeable or mean-spirited. Instead, people with this personality type are knowledgeable and curious with a playful sense of humor, and they can be incredibly entertaining. They simply have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun – one that usually involves a healthy dose of spirited debate.",
                "<b>Breaking the Rules: </b>ENTPs are known for their rebellious streak. For this personality type, no belief is too sacred to be questioned, no idea is too fundamental to be scrutinized, and no rule is too important to be broken or at least thoroughly tested. This may make ENTP personalities seem overly cavalier or defiant, but at their core, their innate tendency to test boundaries has more to do with their desire for innovation and change. As they see it, most people are too ready to do as they’re told and blindly conform to social norms, pressures, and standards. ENTP personalities enjoy the mental exercise of questioning the prevailing mode of thought, and they take a certain pleasure in uncovering the value of underdogs and outliers. Their active mind can’t help but rethink the things that everyone else takes for granted and pushes them in clever new directions. While ENTPs love to brainstorm and think big, these personalities tend to avoid getting caught doing the “grunt work” of implementing their ideas, and they sometimes have a hard time sticking to their goals. To some extent, this makes sense – they have far too many thoughts and suggestions to keep track of them all, let alone turn them into reality. But unless ENTPs develop the willingness to identify and actually follow through on their priorities, they may struggle to harness their full potential.",
                "<b>The Cost of Contrarianism: </b>ENTPs’ capacity for debate is legendary, but that doesn’t mean that it’s always helpful. When they openly question their boss in a meeting or pick apart everything that their significant other says, these sharp personalities may think they’re being champions of rationality and logic. But they may also be doing their chances of success and happiness more harm than good. Not every occasion calls for this personality type’s default contrarianism, and most people can only stand to have their beliefs questioned and their feelings brushed aside for so long. As a result, ENTPs may find that their quarrelsome fun burns many bridges, often inadvertently. These personalities are respected for their vision, confidence, knowledge, and keen sense of humor – but unless they cultivate a bit of sensitivity, they may struggle to maintain deeper relationships or even to achieve their professional goals. With time, many ENTP personalities realize that their ideal life involves other people and that spending too much energy on “winning” arguments ultimately means robbing themselves of the support that they need to get where they want to be in life. The good news is that people with this personality type will never lose their sharply nonconformist edge. They can simply use their cognitive flexibility to understand and explore others’ perspectives, recognizing the value of consideration and compromise alongside logic and progress."

This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying – they just find it fascinating.<br><br><b>2. Quick Thinkers: </b>ENTP personalities have tremendously flexible minds and are able to shift from idea to idea with little effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit. In fact, ENTPs are the most likely personality type to quickly jump from one topic to another when they are enthralled in a conversation, never missing a beat.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Original: </b>Having little attachment to tradition, ENTP personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, they respond with unabashed glee.<br><br><b>4. Excellent Brainstormers: </b>Nothing is quite as enjoyable to people with the ENTP personality type as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work, and presenting ever more possibilities, ENTPs are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Charismatic: </b>People with the ENTP personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought, and ability to connect seemingly separate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.<br><br><b>6. Energetic: </b>When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, ENTP personalities can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Very Argumentative: </b>If there’s anything ENTPs enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which these personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, sometimes leading to a great deal of tension.<br><br><b>2. Insensitive: </b>Being so rational, ENTPs often misjudge others’ feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Intolerant: </b>Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, ENTPs are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny, or it’s not worth bothering with.<br><br><b>4. Can Find It Difficult to Focus: </b>The same flexibility that allows ENTP personalities to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for these active types, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Dislike Practical Matters: </b>ENTPs, with their preference for spontaneity and novelty, often struggle with organization, structure, and all things practical. People with this personality type are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution, these personalities tend to lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.",

They can be both a thrilling and challenging partner. They bring their trademark enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity to their romantic lives, often resulting in relationships that are filled with passion and constant growth. This can be an overwhelming process if their partner doesn’t match up, but when they find someone who shares their love of intellectual exploration, expect an adventure.",
                "<b>Sparks May Fly: </b>Dating these personalities is hardly a boring experience. From their earliest dates, ENTPs test their partner’s limits, pushing boundaries and traditions, looking for open-mindedness and spontaneity. These personalities love engaging with their partner in thought-provoking discussions and debates, and they make good use of their enthusiasm and creativity by delighting and surprising their partner with new experiences. For ENTPs, love is an opportunity for mutual learning and growth. However, their natural impatience and restlessness may become evident as they constantly seek novelty and express their disdain for monotony. This is not a type to buy into the idea of a happy status quo. Balancing their need for new experiences and adventures with the realities of a steady romantic relationship can be a struggle for many people with this personality type. But if ENTPs’ unwavering enthusiasm is met in kind, it can lead to a magnificent relationship characterized by its strength, depth, and spark.",
                "<b>Opportunities for Growth: </b>ENTPs’ love of intellectual engagement and personal growth can sometimes become wearing, especially for partners who prefer emotional intimacy over intellectual sparring. Equally, their urge to question and challenge everything can sometimes translate into perceived argumentativeness or even insensitivity, as they may inadvertently dismiss their partner’s feelings in favor of logic and rational argument. While ENTPs are more open-minded than other Analyst (NT) personality types about others’ perspectives, they are also more likely to express their disdain for such things as emotional sensitivity in cuttingly well-phrased and clear terms, easily hurting their partner’s feelings without realizing it. ENTP personalities may even ignore their partner’s feelings altogether, instead immersing themselves entirely in some distant idea or opportunity.",
                "However, ENTPs are exceptionally adaptive individuals. Their ability and readiness to change their perspectives may save them from being overly confrontational or insensitive. They just have to realize the value of emotional understanding, sensitivity, and compromise in maintaining a strong relationship.

If they’re wrong, they want to be told so, and they want every detail of the faults in their logic to be laid bare, partly in their quest for oftentimes arbitrary truth and partly just so they have to work to defend that logic with counterpoint and parry.",
                "It’s often easy for these personalities to test compatibility with a potential friend. ENTPs are quick-witted, and their primary means of expressing this is in the form of arguments and discussions, where they will easily spend an entire evening debating an idea that they may not even believe in. Consequently, these personalities mainly seek out friends who can keep up with their rapid-fire thought processes and surprise them with original ideas. These debates are rarely taken personally, no matter how heated they become or how striking the disagreement. Much as an athlete competes for the physical exertion and the spirit of competition itself, ENTPs debate for the sake of intellectual stimulation and for the debate itself. In overwhelming victory or crushing defeat, it’s never about dominance, only inspiration to try harder next time.",
                "<b>Never a Dull Moment: </b>They know how to relax and have fun, too, it’s just that “fun” to these irreverent personalities – a bottle of wine and a discussion about the causes of and solutions to some global crisis – could be described as “an evening from hell” by many other types. But ENTPs are a genial and enthusiastic personality type for the most part, and pretty much any situation that allows for conversation and a little wordplay is an enjoyable outing. ENTPs are actually remarkably good at communicating with friends and acquaintances of other personality types. Their natural tendency to argue as effectively as possible means that these personalities are accustomed to communicating in other people’s language and frame of reference, and this translates well into normal conversation. Where ENTPs do have difficulty relating to others is in emotional expression – the Achilles’ heel of all Analyst (NT) types.",
                "<b>Emotions Dismissed: </b>Being inclined to suppress their emotions, when ENTP personalities are faced with a friend who, figuratively or literally, needs a shoulder to cry on, they sometimes have no clue how to handle the situation. They are perfectly willing and happy to offer a series of rational, reasonable solutions to the problem at hand, as they do for any situation where a problem needs to be fixed, but they are generally not known for their sensitivity or outward affection, no matter how intuitively they may understand another’s position. Worse is when an ENTP friend tries to turn these emotional situations into something they find more comfortable: a debate. Given how remarkably good they are at arguing both sides of a point, they are remarkably bad at putting themselves in someone else’s shoes from an emotional standpoint. People with the ENTP personality type should avoid the temptation to turn a discussion about the causes of a friend’s recent breakup into competitive intellectual fodder.",
                "So long as everyone understands not to take their words too personally, anyone who isn’t afraid to discuss new and compelling ideas is likely to find stimulating and thought-provoking friendship with ENTPs. It’s not a compatibility that clicks with everyone, but these personalities don’t really care about being liked by everyone anyway. As long as they get to alternate between being the sounding board and the megaphone, ENTPs and their friends are bound to enjoy one another’s company for a long, long time."

However, one thing that these personalities love more than just about anything is a good challenge or a problem to fix – even if it means that they have to address their own weaknesses in the process. ENTPs take their roles as parents seriously, and they are bound to be affected profoundly by this development in their lives. For their kids, they set out to provide a world full of possibilities in the hope that their children will develop a love for learning, an open-minded perspective, and the confidence to express themselves without worrying too much about what other people have to say about it.",
                "<b>Raising Freethinkers: </b>From the beginning, ENTPs’ distaste for rules and regulations is evident, and they are likely to give their young children the freedom necessary to explore on their own. Independence is one of this personality type’s greatest needs, and they feel that no person is complete without an independent mind. As their children grow and develop, people with the ENTP personality type encourage them to voice objections, opinions, and alternatives. They teach their children to approach these options from a position of impartiality and logic – to state what is more effective rather than what would make them feel good. As in their other relationships, this quality of emotional inaccessibility is where ENTP parents struggle.",
                "As their children grow into adolescence and learn to find a balance in healthy emotional expression, ENTP parents may find themselves exasperated. While always up for a good debate on just about any subject, they may need to work on how they handle their kid’s emotional outbursts and arguments. ENTP personalities are perfectly capable, but even they have their limits and rules when it comes to emotional conflict.",
                "<b>Finding a Better Way: </b>Luckily, ENTP parents recognize what’s at stake: they want their children to grow into smart, independent, honest adults. To convey those values, these personalities know that they need, like with any other debate, to communicate in terms that are accessible to all sides. If that means learning how to use varied tools of emotional expression in order to become more emotionally adept, so be it.",

                "In the world of careers, people with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) have the benefit of being naturally engaged and interested in being productive and helpful. These energetic personalities are focused on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. This means that ENTPs tend to value careers that allow them the freedom to explore, experiment, and engage with various ideas and perspectives. ENTPs are a versatile personality type, and while it may take time for them to get to a point where they can fully utilize their skillset, they are likely to find that those qualities translate well into pretty much any career that really challenges them while also constantly piquing their interest. Not every career allows ENTP personalities to utilize both their impressive level of unbridled brainpower and their creativity, but they have been known to shine in such diverse careers as entrepreneurship, engineering, acting, and photography. So long as they are honest with themselves about their strengths and weaknesses, they can succeed in most any career that is in need of a new line of thinking.",
                "<b>The Gift of Curiosity: </b>All this intellectual power can be intimidating, but people with the ENTP personality type have the added benefit of being excellent communicators – especially in face-to-face conversation. Though they dislike the constraints of managing others (and of being managed), this social adaptability allows them to be natural leaders, showing the way forward and inspiring others with sound logic and intellectual prowess. While others may object to these plans with emotional considerations or general resistance to change, things that ENTPs place little value in, these competing comments are usually outmaneuvered by these personalities’ deft arguments and subtly shifting goals. Consequently, ENTPs make brilliant lawyers, psychologists, systems analysts, and scientists. It’s also possible for these clever personalities to thrive as sales representatives, as they rationalize purchase decisions that may otherwise seem discretionary – so long as their managers know to give them the space that they need to work their magic. ",
                "<b>An Independent Spirit: </b>Really, it all comes down to a sense of personal freedom for ENTP personalities to know that they are allowed to apply themselves fully to understanding and solving the problems that interest them. Routine, structure, and formal rules all feel like unnecessary hindrances to these active problem-solvers. ENTPs may find that their best careers allow them to engage in their intellectual pursuits on their own terms, as freelance consultants or software engineers. The key for people with the ENTP personality type is to have the patience to get to a position that allows for these freedoms, to be in an environment long enough that not just their colleagues but their managers and, in time, their subordinates recognize what it is that they bring to the table. These powerful types have exceptional qualities – it’s quantifying their achievements and skills that presents the biggest challenge. But once they’ve got their foot in the door, once they’ve got a willing ear higher in the hierarchy, the sky’s the limit.",

            "Workplace Habits" => [
                "People with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) have straightforward expectations in the workplace, but ones that aren’t always easy to meet. Strong believers in meritocracy, ENTP personalities expect their ideas to be heard by those above them, seek out robust debate among their peers, and demand that those they manage offer up new solutions and ideas regardless of their positions. While this isn’t always how things play out in reality, they know what to look for and can avoid those strictly hierarchical institutions that they would otherwise struggle with.",
                "<b>ENTP Subordinates: </b>A meritocratic preference is clearest with ENTP subordinates, as they are comfortable challenging their managers’ ideas and have a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and guidelines. ENTP personalities back this unorthodox behavior with their keen mind and curiosity and are as capable of adopting new methods as they are of suggesting that others do so. If something can be done better, it’s as simple as that. They will gladly take criticism, so long as it’s logical and performance-oriented. The biggest challenge for ENTP subordinates is that it is often the fate of the “lower” positions to implement the details, do the dirty work, and follow through on plans set out by their managers. This couldn’t be further from what people with this personality type prefer to spend their time on. They can’t stand simple, routine work, and monotonous tasks are the stuff of nightmares. Things go over much better if managers are able to properly utilize ENTPs’ preference for tackling complex challenges and diverse projects.",
                "<b>ENTP Colleagues: </b>It is as colleagues that ENTP personalities prove most polarizing, as their passions for brainstorming, debate, and overanalysis drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues up the wall but serve as stimulating inspiration for those who appreciate the innovation brought to the table. Nothing bothers people with this personality type more than getting out of a meeting where everyone agreed with the first plan presented, only to hear everyone complain about how stupid the plan was 10 minutes later – but they “didn’t want to make waves.” ENTPs strive for honest, direct, and objective assessments of these ideas, so much so that they often earn reputations for their insensitivity and condescension. Luckily, ENTP personalities know how to relax too, and their witty wordplay, healthy sense of humor, and outgoing nature usually help them win new friends quickly and easily. Always willing to draw on their repository of knowledge, conversations with these inventive types are informative and entertaining, which makes it easy for them to be the go-to person for tough problems that stump more predictable approaches.",
                "<b>ENTP Managers: </b>While not always their goal, management is often where these personalities are most at home, allowing them the freedom to fiddle with different approaches and come up with innovative ways to tackle new challenges without having to handle the tedious step-by-step implementation of these plans. ENTP managers are open-minded and flexible, not just granting but also expecting the same freedom of thought that they themselves enjoy. This can lead to disorder and conflicting ideas and approaches being put forward, but ENTP personalities are also great at accurately and objectively assessing which plan is likely to be most effective. This doesn’t always help them make friends, but being liked is rarely their primary goal in this role. Instead, ENTPs would rather be respected and seen as intelligent and capable. And whether they are liked or not, people with this personality type hold firm ground in rational debates, making them fearsome advocates for their teams. The challenge for these personalities is focus, as they may find themselves jumping from project to project in a quest for novelty and excitement before their teams are able to wrap up the details of their existing goals and obligations."

            "Conclusion" => [
                "Armed with a powerful intellect and vivid imagination, people with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the ENTP personality type.<BR><BR>At some point in reading through your results, you probably hit a tipping point. You went from that trademark ENTP skepticism to “huh...” to “wait, what?” You may even be a little uncomfortable because you are really not used to being understood, even by the people you’re closest to.<BR><BR>Chances are, you’ve accepted that as part of who you are, and maybe even grown proud of it. But embracing that disconnection isn’t a requirement for ENTP personalities. It’s a misused defense mechanism, leading you down a lonely, inefficient path – gaining insight into yourself and others is so much more rewarding."

                "Idealistic and principled, people with the <b>INFJ personality type</b> (Advocates) aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For these compassionate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world. While they have lofty goals and ambitions, INFJs shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim to never lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at large but according to their own wisdom and intuition.",
                "<b>Seeking Purpose: </b>Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, INFJs tend to carry around a sense – whether conscious or not – of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in with those around them. This isn’t to say that INFJ personalities can’t enjoy social acceptance or close relationships – only that they sometimes feel misunderstood or at odds with the world. Fortunately, this sense of being out of step doesn’t diminish INFJs’ commitment to making the world a better place. These personalities are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. They often feel called to use their strengths – including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity – to uplift others and spread compassion.",
                "Many INFJs see helping others as their mission in life, and they’re always looking for ways to step in and speak up for what is right. People with this personality type also aspire to fix society’s deeper problems in the hopes that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past. At times, however, INFJs may focus so intently on their ideals that they don’t take adequate care of themselves – a pattern that can lead to stress and burnout.",
                "<b>Connecting with Others (and Themselves): </b>INFJs value deep, authentic relationships with others. Few things bring these personalities as much joy as truly knowing another person – and being known in return. INFJs enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk, and they tend to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive. This emotional honesty and insight can make a powerful impression on the people around them. Thoughtful and often selfless, INFJ personalities pour a great deal of energy and care into their relationships, but this doesn’t mean that they always feel appreciated in return. People with this personality type tend to slow down and really evaluate how what they do might impact others before they take action. Consequently, it can frustrate them when other people don’t recognize their good intentions. INFJs are very sensitive to criticism of any kind and can take things very personally.",
                "<b>A Personal Mission: </b>Many INFJ personalities feel that their life has a unique purpose – a mission that they were put onto this earth to fulfill. For them, one of the most rewarding aspects of life is seeking out this purpose – and then, once they’ve found it, striving to do it justice. When INFJs encounter inequity or unfairness, they rarely give up – instead, they consult their intuition and their compassion to find a solution. With their innate ability to balance the heart with the head, these dedicated types are hardwired to right the wrongs of the world, no matter how big or small. These personalities just need to remember that while they’re busy taking care of everyone else, they need to pause sometimes and take care of themselves as well."

These personalities strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.<br><br><b>2. Principled: </b>INFJs tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. They consider lying to be morally wrong, and they make a concerted effort to not deceive others – even when they could directly benefit from doing so. In fact, they are the least likely personality type to say they sometimes take advantage of other people.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Passionate: </b>INFJ personalities crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, they want to chase after their dreams. This isn’t a personality type that shies away from shooting for the stars – they are energized and impassioned by the beauty of their visions for the future.<br><br><b>4. Altruistic: </b>People with this personality type aren’t happy to succeed at another person’s expense. INFJs want to use their strengths for the greater good, and they rarely lose sight of how their words and actions might affect others. In their heart of hearts, they want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around them.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Creative: </b>INFJ personalities aren’t exactly like everyone else – and that’s a wonderful thing. They embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Sensitive to Criticism: </b>INFJs are often averse to criticism, especially if they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive, dismissive, or angry.<br><br><b>2. Reluctant to Open Up: </b>INFJ personalities value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when they don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Perfectionistic: </b>These visionary personalities are all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. INFJs might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.<br><br><b>4. Avoiding the Ordinary: </b>INFJs yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it’s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, they may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Prone to Burnout: </b>INFJs’ perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.",

            "Romantic Relationships" => [
                "People with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) look for depth and meaning in their relationships – and their romantic relationships are no different. This is a type known for having a vibrant, vivid imagination, but few INFJs can imagine themselves settling for a match founded on anything less than true love. It can take time for them to find a compatible partner. Some people might think that INFJs are too choosy, and it’s true that this personality type can be prone to unrealistic expectations. In fact, when they’re single, they tend to construct their ideal partner in their mind. And they might be tempted to hold out for this “perfect” partner or relationship, when in reality, that perfect match just doesn’t exist. The good news? INFJs’ idealism – if balanced with just enough realism – can actually enhance their love life.",
                "<b>Is This For Real?: </b>People with the INFJ personality type tend to be attuned to their core values and keenly aware of what matters to them on a soul level. This helps them look beyond surface-level attraction and understand whether they’re compatible with someone on a deeper, more meaningful level. Importantly, these insights are essential for helping INFJs avoid matches that aren’t founded on authenticity or shared principles. INFJ personalities care about integrity, and they tend to bristle when people try to change them or talk them into something that they don’t believe. As a result, they gravitate toward partners who appreciate them as they are.",
                "Once someone with the INFJ personality type does find a suitable relationship, they rarely take it for granted. Instead, they tend to look for ways to grow as individuals and strengthen their connection with their partner. These personalities believe in honest communication and the importance of having an open dialogue in solving issues and disagreements. Their ideal romantic relationship involves regular conversations full of depth where both partners can delve into each other’s minds and expand their horizons. This can help INFJs’ relationships reach a profound level of openness and sincerity of which many people can only dream.",
                "<b>The Power of Love: </b>People with this personality type create a depth to their relationship that can hardly be described in conventional terms. Because of their sensitivity and insight, INFJs can make their partner feel heard and understood in beautiful ways. These personalities aren’t afraid to express their love, and they feel it with all their heart. INFJs tend to recognize that love isn’t a passive emotion but rather an opportunity to grow and learn, and they expect their partner to share this mindset. As a result, relationships with these personalities are not for the uncommitted or the shallow. INFJs are intensely passionate in ways that transcend the present moment, and what truly fulfills them is the way that a loving, meaningful relationship evolves and deepens over time. In their heart of hearts, people with the INFJ personality type crave an emotional and even spiritual connection with their partner. They cherish not just the act of being in a relationship but also what it means to become one with another person in mind, body, and soul.",

            "Friendships" => [
                "People with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) rarely settle for shallow, superficial friendships. When it comes to social fulfillment, they aren’t satisfied by casual interactions with colleagues or classmates. INFJ personalities crave authentic, meaningful friendships – friendships that allow them to share their dreams, bare their soul, and feel understood and accepted for who they are. And if that means having just one or two confidants rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, so be it. While INFJs may seem quiet or reserved to the world at large, these personalities absolutely light up around their close friends. Few things bring them more pleasure or delight than talking through their passions, interests, and beliefs with a kindred spirit. People with this personality type enjoy the pleasure of their own company, but they still find it liberating to let their guard down and be completely and utterly themselves with a friend who they know they can trust.",
                "<b>Searching for a Heart of Gold: </b>INFJs are known for having great expectations – not just for themselves but also for their friendships. High on this list of expectations is authenticity. If they have to be fake or tone themselves down to gain someone’s approval, then that person probably isn’t the best friend for them. And it’s hard for people with this personality type to respect someone who isn’t also an authentic and honest person themselves. Another expectation that INFJs bring to their friendships is mutual support and growth. Having fun together is wonderful, but for these personalities, it isn’t quite enough. They want to surround themselves with friends who inspire them to learn, expand, and improve themselves. For INFJs, the surest way for two friends to deepen their bond is by helping each other move forward on their respective life missions. This can be a tall order for many personalities. INFJs often feel that it’s difficult to meet the sort of friends that they’re seeking – friends who share the same idealistic values. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes worry that they need to settle for less-than-fulfilling friendships – or else accept being alone.",
                "<b>Loyalty and Authenticity: </b>Fortunately, they are more than capable of finding the types of friends that they long to meet – they might just have to devote additional energy to it. And when people with the INFJ personality type do encounter like-minded individuals, the bonds that form are profoundly deep and meaningful, making the search worthwhile. INFJs should keep in mind that sometimes the friends they seek might be hiding in plain sight, among acquaintances whom they simply don’t know all that well. This personality type is known for having astute first impressions of other people, but even they can miss the deeper potentials of the people they encounter on a daily basis. When they give these strangers a chance, INFJ personalities may find that they share values and attitudes that make them compatible on a deeper level. Ultimately, the only way to be counted among INFJs’ true friends is to be authentic, honest, and real. Over the years, these personalities may end up with just a few true friendships rather than a wide circle of casual acquaintances. But for those lucky few, there is almost no limit to what INFJs would sacrifice for the people they hold near to their hearts.",

            "Parenthood" => [
                "As parents, people with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) have a clear vision for what matters to them: raising their children to be independent and all-around good people. INFJs take their responsibilities seriously, and if these personalities become parents, they think deeply about how they can shape their children’s lives and experiences in positive ways. Parenthood isn’t easy, but few expect it to be. INFJ personalities know that many of life’s most worthwhile pursuits are also the most challenging – a mindset that helps them keep sight of joy and fulfillment amid the daily struggles of raising children. In many ways, parenting allows people with the INFJ personality type to make wonderful use of their strengths, including creativity, compassion, and the incredible devotion that they feel toward those they love.",
                "<b>Be Unique, Just Like Me: </b>Caring and loyal, INFJ parents are willing to do pretty much whatever it takes to better their children’s lives. But it would be a mistake to think that parents with this personality type are pushovers. In fact, INFJs can be quite strict, because their commitment to building their children’s character in the long term is rarely outweighed by momentary considerations. While they bring many gifts to raising children, it’s important to note that no parent is perfect. At times, people with the INFJ personality type may hold their children to unrealistic standards that don’t take into account each child’s personality or stage of development. For example, an INFJ parent might expect their child to model the same integrity and honesty that they expect from themselves, becoming dismayed whenever their child behaves in a way that they perceive to be ungenerous or unethical. Or INFJs might push their children to be independent, creative, and unique, seeing it as a concerning trend if their child craves external guidance or wants to stick to the status quo.",
                "To a child, all of these expectations can feel contradictory and impossible to fulfill. And depending on the child’s personality and their developmental stage, these expectations might quite literally be impossible for their kids to achieve. In adolescence, children might rebel by flouting these standards or by espousing beliefs that go against their parents’ values. In this situation, INFJs may feel that their children are criticizing or rejecting them – a hurtful thing to such a sensitive personality type. That being said, it’s also important to remember that INFJ personalities are well-known for their capabilities of empathy and understanding. So, while initial misconceptions might bring about challenges, they have an inherent ability to reassess, adapt, and evolve their approach.",
                "<b>A Job Well Done: </b>INFJs strive to make sure that their children grow up with a firm understanding of the difference between right and wrong. Parents with this personality type encourage their children to fight for a cause that they believe in and to be the best they can be. Whatever age their children might be, these parents can find a great deal of fulfillment and meaning simply in helping their children learn to be true to themselves. Ultimately, INFJ parents tend to realize that it isn’t a sign of failure if their children turn out differently than they’d expected. Instead, they come to see this as a sign that they’ve successfully raised someone who has the ability to form their own ideals. And their kids often come to appreciate the combination of independence and integrity with which they were raised – especially as they get older.",

                "For people with the INFJ personality type (Advocates), professional decisions are not guided by conventional yardsticks of success like financial gain or status but by the potential their work holds for meaningful connection and personal fulfillment. These personalities long to find a career that aligns with their values and their dreams – a career that allows them to fulfill their unique mission in this world. To INFJs, a job isn’t satisfying if it doesn’t offer a deeper sense of purpose – no matter how good the salary is. The good news is that people with this personality type can use their creativity and determination to find work that suits their needs in just about any field. In fact, INFJs have trouble deciding which job is best for them because they’re able to imagine so many possibilities. They may see half a dozen wildly different paths forward, each with its own set of rewards. This can be exciting but also stress inducing, because picking just one means letting go of so many others. They may even feel a sense of loss when so many doors close because they finally committed to one path. But they needn’t worry, as one can have many different paths, purposes, and jobs in this lifetime.",
                "<b>The Search for Purpose: </b>For these altruistic personalities, jobs that involve helping and connecting with people can be deeply satisfying. It’s no surprise, then, that many INFJs gravitate toward work as counselors, therapists, psychologists, social workers, teachers, yoga instructors, and spiritual leaders. They may also enjoy service industry positions that allow them to interact directly and build genuine relationships with their customers. Careers in health care can also be rewarding options for INFJs, including occupations such as nursing, physical or occupational therapy, medicine, nutrition, or more holistic paths such as acupuncture.",
                "INFJs are often passionate communicators, though sometimes in subtle ways. This explains why they are often drawn to careers in writing, creating many popular books, blogs, stories, video games, and screenplays. For people with this personality type, the opportunity to tell stories for a living can be nothing short of a dream come true. Other INFJs might pursue music, photography, design, illustration, or fine art. Even if these artistic pursuits aren’t their primary job, many find that creative side hustles offer a much-needed outlet for the themes and ideas that occupy their imaginations. Nonprofit workplaces, from museums to nature centers to food pantries, also hold a special appeal for INFJs. With their focus on serving the community rather than drawing a profit, these organizations can be a natural fit for these personalities. But even in workplaces that are very much for-profit, INFJs can find ways to direct their energy and creativity toward helping others. No matter what it says on their business cards, their insight can enable these personalities to spot unusual patterns and come up with outside-the-box solutions, creating real change in others’ lives.",
                "<b>A Sense of Mission: </b>INFJs are incredibly versatile, but some work environments may rub them the wrong way. This is especially true of workplaces that offer little independence or agency, forcing employees to adhere to rigid, repetitive protocols without regard for their individual needs or strengths. People with this personality type may also chafe at the criticism and pressure that come with cutthroat, competitive work environments. For this reason, many INFJ personalities seek out more flexible, autonomous positions – or branch off altogether to start their own businesses. They may also find it gratifying to create bridges between seemingly disparate professional fields – for example, by writing about psychology or by being an environmental lawyer. Such hybrid careers can offer plenty of opportunities for INFJs to exercise their creativity and their love of learning. In truth, people with this personality type can do well in any field. To be truly happy, however, INFJs often need to find work that aligns with their values and allows them some independence. They crave opportunities to learn and grow alongside the people they are helping. When this happens, INFJ personalities may finally feel that they are fulfilling their life’s mission and contributing to the well-being of humanity on a personal level.",

And it’s a given that an ideal career for an INFJ personality must be in line with their individual values. Anything that gets in the way of these values – from red tape and meaningless rules to office politics and unscrupulous coworkers – can seriously sap INFJs’ motivation. This is a personality type that thrives in environments that promote fairness and equality. Most INFJs prefer not to think of themselves as above or below anyone else – no matter where they are on the job ladder.",
                "<b>INFJ Subordinates: </b>INFJs value cooperation, sensitivity, and independence. As employees, they gravitate toward managers who are open-minded and willing to consider their input. These personalities may become frustrated when they feel unheard, so having a manager who listens to them can make all the difference. Because INFJs tend to act on their convictions and aim to do their best, their morale can be vulnerable to criticism, particularly if it’s unwarranted. Other morale killers for these personalities may include strict rules, formal structures, and routine tasks. They may find it especially dispiriting when they’re asked to redo their work, particularly if it’s for a reason that just doesn’t seem valid to them. Of course, a perfect work environment isn’t always possible. INFJ employees with less-than-ideal managers may need to draw on their inner resilience and seek out other mentors. The good news is that people with this personality type are more than capable of handling workplace challenges, including the challenge of having a difficult manager.",

They carry a sense of personal accountability for the tasks entrusted to them, enabling them to consistently deliver high-quality work. This conscientiousness tends to earn these personalities the trust and respect of their coworkers, paving the way for effective collaborations and shared successes. As colleagues, INFJs can be quite popular and well respected. People with this personality type are often seen as helpful, eloquent, and capable coworkers. Among their greatest strengths is their ability to identify others’ motives and understand the root causes of conflict before anyone else even senses a disturbance. At times, efficiency may be less of a priority for INFJs than collaborating with and helping colleagues who need a boost. While this is usually a strength, there is a risk that others will take advantage of INFJs’ desire to help. They may find themselves picking up the slack for their less dedicated coworkers at the expense of their own energy and well-being. Although they tend to be well-liked among their colleagues, INFJ personalities are still Introverts. From time to time, they may need to step back and work alone, pursuing their own goals in their own ways. This isn’t a sign of resentment or ill will – but rather a signal of INFJs’ need to balance serving others with their own self-care.",
                "<b>INFJ Managers: </b>As managers, INFJs may dislike wielding their power. They prefer to think of everyone as equals, no matter what a person’s business card might say. Rather than micromanage their subordinates, INFJ personalities often prefer to empower them to think and act independently. They work hard to encourage others and promote an atmosphere of mutual respect, and they tend to lead by example, consistently displaying a high level of integrity and dedication. That’s not to say that INFJs have low standards – far from it. Their sense of equality means that they expect their subordinates to live up to the standards that they set for themselves. Bosses with this personality type want their employees to be rigorous, motivated, reliable, and unfailingly honest, and they will notice if anyone misses the mark. INFJ managers can be particularly stern if they catch someone behaving in a way that they consider unethical. These personalities have little tolerance for lapses in reliability or morality. When their employees’ good intentions match their own, however, INFJ bosses work tirelessly to ensure that their entire team feels valued, fulfilled, and successful."

                "Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, people with the <B>INFP personality type</B> (Mediators) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their mind. INFPs are known for their sensitivity – these personalities can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them. They are known to be extremely sentimental and nostalgic, often holding onto special keepsakes and memorabilia that brighten their days and fill their heart with joy. Idealistic and empathetic, people with the INFP personality type long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. Due to the fast-paced and competitive nature of our society, they may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique. Yet it is precisely because INFPs brim with such rich sensitivity and profound creativity that they possess the unique potential to connect deeply and initiate positive change.",
                "<b>The Gift of Empathy: </b>INFP personalities share a sincere curiosity about the depths of human nature. Introspective to the core, they’re exquisitely attuned to their own thoughts and feelings, but they yearn to understand the people around them as well. INFPs are compassionate and nonjudgmental, always willing to hear another person’s story. When someone opens up to them or turns to them for comfort, they feel honored to listen and be of help. Empathy is among the INFP personality type’s greatest gifts, but at times it can be a liability. The troubles of the world weigh heavily on their shoulders, and these personalities can be vulnerable to internalizing other people’s negative moods or mindsets. Unless they learn to set boundaries, INFPs may feel overwhelmed by just how many wrongs there are that need to be set right.",
                "<b>Speaking Their Truth: </b>Few things make INFP personalities more uneasy than pretending to be someone they aren’t. With their sensitivity and their commitment to authenticity, people with this personality type tend to crave opportunities for creative self-expression. It comes as no surprise, then, that many famous INFPs are poets, writers, actors, and artists. They can’t help but muse about the meaning and purpose of life, dreaming up all sorts of stories, ideas, and possibilities along the way. Through these imaginative landscapes, these soulful personalities can explore their own inner nature as well as their place in the world. While this is a beautiful trait, INFPs sometimes show a tendency to daydream and fantasize rather than take action. At times, these personalities may intensely deliberate with themselves in their heads, wrestling with their options until the last possible moment. To avoid feeling frustrated, unfulfilled, or incapable, INFPs need to make sure that they take decisive steps to turn their dreams and ideas into reality.",
                "<b>In Search of a Calling: </b>People with this personality type tend to feel directionless or stuck until they connect with a sense of purpose for their life. For many, this purpose has something to do with uplifting others. And while they want to help anyone and everyone, INFP personalities need to focus their energy and efforts – otherwise, they can end up exhausted. Fortunately, like flowers in the spring, an INFP’s creativity and idealism can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although they know the world will never be perfect, they still care about making it better however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why INFP personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever they go."

                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>1. Empathetic: </b>People with the INFP personality type (Mediators) don’t just care about those around them in an abstract sense – they can actually feel another person’s emotions, from joy and elation to sorrow and regret. Because of their sensitivity, these personalities tend to be thoughtful and kindhearted, and they hate the idea of hurting anyone, even unintentionally.<br><br><b>2. Generous: </b>INFPs rarely enjoy succeeding at others’ expense. They feel called to share the good things in their lives, give credit where it’s due, and uplift the people around them. These personalities want to contribute to a world where every voice is heard and no one’s needs go unmet.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Open-Minded: </b>Tolerant and accepting, INFPs try not to judge anyone else’s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This is a personality type that prefers compassion to faultfinding. Many feel empathy even for those who have done wrong. Because they’re so accepting, INFPs often become confidants for their friends and loved ones – and occasionally for total strangers.<br><br><b>4. Creative: </b>INFP personalities love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their mind to wander through all sorts of ideas and possibilities and daydreams. It’s no wonder, then, that many INFPs are drawn to creative pursuits – or that this personality type is well represented among writers and artists.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Passionate: </b>INFPs contain a deep well of passion, primarily driven by their profound empathy, strong internal values, and ceaseless curiosity about the human experience. When an idea or movement captures their imagination, these individuals want to give their whole heart to it. People with the INFP personality type may not always be outspoken, but that doesn’t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that speaks to their beliefs and convictions.<br><br><b>6. Idealistic: </b>INFP personalities strive to follow their conscience even when doing the right thing isn’t easy or convenient. They rarely lose sight of their desire to live a meaningful, purpose-filled life – one that helps others and leaves the world a better place.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Unrealistic: </b>Nothing in this world is perfect – and that can be a difficult truth for INFPs to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set them up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams.<br><br><b>2. Self-Isolating: </b>INFP personalities long to connect with others, but they don’t always know how. Especially in new environments, they may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with the INFP personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Unfocused: </b>INFPs’ imaginative, introspective nature doesn’t always lend itself to productivity. Many people with this personality type get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isn’t that they are incapable – rather, it’s that INFPs run into problems when they become so caught up in different ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action.<br><br><b>4. Emotionally Vulnerable: </b>The emotional attunement of these personalities is among their greatest strengths. But unless they establish boundaries, they can be at risk of absorbing other people’s negative moods or attitudes. And this can be detrimental to their personal peace and productivity, as INFPs are the most likely personality type to say negative emotions get in the way of their ability to think clearly.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Too Eager to Please: </b>Conflict tends to be stressful for INFPs, who yearn for harmony and acceptance. When someone dislikes or disapproves of them, these personalities may become fixated on trying to clear the air and change that person’s mind. They might even take responsibility and apologize for things that are not their fault at all in an effort to make sure that they are in everyone’s good graces. Unfortunately, INFPs’ desire to please others can drain their energy, eclipsing their inner wisdom and their awareness of their own needs.<br><br><b>6. Self-Critical: </b>INFPs believe in their unique potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves. When these personalities fail to live up to these visions, they may accuse themselves of being useless or selfish or woefully inadequate. Taken too far, this self-criticism can discourage INFPs, leading them to give up on even their dearest dreams.",

            "Romantic Relationships" => [
                "People with the INFP personality type (Mediators) are dreamers and idealists, especially when it comes to romance. INFPs believe in the power and beauty of true love, and they sincerely hope to never settle for anything less. It’s fair to say, then, that INFP personalities approach the world of romance with high expectations. They may have spent years daydreaming about the perfect relationship, imagining how it would feel to share their innermost selves with another person. But the reality of dating can come as something of a shock, forcing them to grapple with a challenging question: If they want to be in a relationship, will they have to compromise on their ideals?",
                "<b>Hopeless Romantics: </b>INFPs don’t just want to find a partner – they want to connect with a soulmate. Thoughtful and open-minded, these personalities are generally willing to consider going out with all sorts of people. INFPs pride themselves on their ability to look past a potential partner’s superficial traits – such as appearance, social status, or possessions – and focus on deeper, more meaningful signals of compatibility. But it would be a mistake to think that INFPs don’t have preconceived standards for a significant other. With their active minds and imaginations, people with this personality type tend to develop and carry with them a vision of their ideal partner – a vision that may be based on a favorite fictional character, a person they once knew, or simply the stories they’ve told themselves about how love “should” look. When they meet someone new, most INFP personalities can’t help but compare that person with the ideal soulmate they’ve envisioned. Unsurprisingly, such comparisons tend to weed out more than a few potential partners. It can be difficult – if not impossible – for a real, flesh-and-blood person to live up to this type’s cherished dreams.",
                "<b>Making an Effort: </b>With time, many INFPs come to learn that true love doesn’t just magically happen – it takes compromise, understanding, and work. After all, no partner is perfect, and even the most beautiful relationships have their challenges. Fortunately, people with this personality type can find a great deal of joy in the effort that it takes to strengthen a relationship. When they fall in love, INFPs reveal just how much passion thrums beneath their quiet exteriors. Devoted and thoughtful, they often express their affection through written words, handmade gifts, or meticulously planned experiences that resonate with their partner’s interests. They also tend to respect their partner’s independence, aiming to accept their partner as they are. That said, these personalities also want to help their partner learn, grow, and pursue their goals. INFPs are always dreaming up ways to improve themselves and the world around them, and the last thing they’d want is for their partner to feel unhappy or stuck. Many people with this personality type dedicate themselves to helping their partner improve their life. While this is a noble goal, they must be sure to keep track of their own needs and make sure that their partner is really ready to change. Provided they do so, INFPs’ support and devotion can make all the difference in their partner’s life.",
                "<b>Finding What's Real: </b>INFP personalities tend to promote harmony over disagreement. Although this lends stability to their relationships, it can also lead to problems. To steer clear of conflict, they may avoid talking openly about things that are bothering them – instead, they might mentally fixate on the problem or try to solve it on their own. INFPs may also focus on making their partner happy, to the detriment of their own priorities and sense of self. Their tendency to internalize their feelings can make INFPs susceptible to hurt. Disappointments and heartbreaks hit hard, often leading them to retreat into their shell. People with this personality type may need to remind themselves that open, honest communication is necessary in a relationship, even if it isn’t always easy. In fact, such moments of candor can transform a relationship for the better. Despite these challenges, INFPs remain steadfast in their search for true emotional connection. To love and be loved authentically is their ultimate romantic goal, making their approach to love a profound, beautiful journey guided by their sensitive heart. As long as they communicate openly, INFP personalities are more than capable of staying true to themselves in a relationship – and encouraging the person that they care about to do the same."

            "Friendships" => [
                "When it comes to their social life, people with the INFP personality type (Mediators) may find themselves caught in a web of contradictions. INFPs crave alone time, but they’re also vulnerable to loneliness. They long to feel accepted and well-liked, but they hate the idea of pretending to be anyone but their authentic self. And while these personalities hesitate to draw attention to themselves, they don’t want to be invisible, either. The good news is that, in the company of true friends, INFPs can escape the hamster wheel of these insecurities and focus on what really matters. For these personalities, friendship is a precious commodity – an opportunity for two people to lift each other up and change each other’s lives for the better. INFPs truly believe in the old saying that “a friend in need is a friend indeed.” Few things bolster their sense of purpose like being there for someone they care about. Perhaps because of their intense investment in these relationships, INFPs tend to feel most fulfilled by spending time with a small, intimate circle of friends. Quality trumps quantity for these sometimes shy personalities, as they prefer relationships with depth where they can share their wildest hopes, dreams, and fears without having to worry about being judged. Acquaintances may come and go, but their real inner circle likely includes some lifelong friends.",
                "<b>Searching for a Kindred Spirit: </b>Although INFPs are warm and accepting, they don’t always find it easy to make friends. This may be because superficial, casual relationships can leave these personalities feeling a bit empty. INFPs are looking for lasting, authentic friendships with people who share their desire to think and feel deeply, to do the right thing, and to give more to the world than they take from it. They enjoy delving into deep, philosophical discussions and exploring different ideas, often bridging the gap between reality and the fantastical. That said, this type is capable of befriending all sorts of people. INFPs’ combination of the Intuitive (N) and Prospecting (P) personality traits draws them to diverse perspectives, which helps them appreciate friends whose experiences and worldviews are totally different from their own. These personalities may actually find it invigorating to connect with someone who, on the surface, has little in common with them.",
                "<b>Friends for Life: </b>When INFPs befriend someone, they may secretly (or not so secretly) hope to stay close with that person for life. These personalities are capable of strong, stable relationships marked by passionate support, subtle poetic wit, and a profound level of emotional insight. Long-standing friendships tend to draw out less obvious aspects of this personality type, including a fierce protective streak. Many INFPs find that they can stand up for their friends in ways that they’d struggle to manage for themselves. Although INFP personalities value their friendships, they also need personal space and alone time in order to recharge. At times, people with this personality type may withdraw from even their closest friends in order to reconnect with themselves and restore their energy, as Introverts often do. These departures are usually temporary, but INFPs may need to make sure that their friends don’t feel snubbed by their absence. All in all, navigating INFP friendships is a deeply personal and emotionally enriching journey. Their friendships are marked by unhindered empathy, intellectual explorations, and an incredible depth of understanding, making them one of the most cherished friends to have.",

            "Parenthood" => [
                "For people with the INFP personality type (Mediators), life is a journey – but even as they find their own way through the world, these personalities feel called to help others embark on their own journeys toward meaning, fulfillment, and happiness. In their understated, nondomineering way, INFPs love guiding others to learn and grow – and parenthood can be an incredibly rewarding opportunity for them to do exactly that. From the start, INFP parents aim to be warm, caring, and open-minded. People with this personality type delight in their children’s wide-eyed wonder at the world, and they want to give their children freedom – freedom to form their own opinions, discover their own interests, and grow into their unique selves. INFP parents counterbalance these freedoms by creating a stable foundation of support and acceptance in the hopes that their children never forget just how much they are loved.",
                "<b>Coping with Challenges: </b>INFPs may enjoy raising free spirits, but that doesn’t mean that they’re totally hands-off. They want to teach key values to their children, including honesty, equity, and the importance of caring for others. They also want their children to understand the meaning of personal responsibility, especially when it comes to not harming others or taking advantage of people for personal gain. Like parents of any personality type, INFPs inevitably face challenges. They take their parenting responsibilities seriously, so it can feel like a personal failure when their children misbehave in ways both large and small. These personalities may be especially upset when they see their children behaving in ways that don’t seem considerate or ethical. When their children do something wrong, INFP personalities may find themselves wondering, Have I failed as a parent? The danger here is that they might become so focused on blaming themselves that they don’t establish appropriate consequences for their children’s actions. Discipline may not come easily to people with the INFP personality type, but when balanced with their caring, gentle nature, it can become a powerful tool in their mission to teach their children the difference between right and wrong.",
                "<b>Balancing Structure with Spontaneity: </b>INFP parents naturally want to serve as good role models. They try to show their children the best side of themselves, keeping their problems, negative emotions, and frustrations under wraps. This can preserve a sense of harmony in the household, helping their children feel safe and cared for. By the same token, INFPs often try to shield their children from the greater problems in the world. This is certainly appropriate when their children are young, but eventually, they need to find ways to talk through tougher issues with their little ones. Another hurdle for many parents with this personality type is establishing practical, day-to-day structures and rules for their children. Fortunately, INFP personalities can use their creative energy to impose boundaries without stifling their children’s curiosity and enthusiasm. These parents have a remarkable ability to put themselves in other people’s shoes, and this enables them to come up with schedules and rules that truly work for their children’s individual needs. When they balance structure with spontaneity, INFPs can help their children grow into their most caring, responsible, and joyful selves. People with this personality type are driven by a profound sense of duty and love toward their children. As natural dreamers and free spirits themselves, they place an incredible amount of faith in their children’s unique abilities and aspire to support their passions – whether they lead to prosperity or not, emphasizing the beauty of pursuing what genuinely resonates in their kids’ hearts.",

                "Many people with the INFP personality type (Mediators) long for a career that doesn’t just take care of the bills but also feels personally fulfilling. They want to spend their days doing something they genuinely love, preferably without too much stress or drama. Ever the idealists, these personalities might struggle to find a profession that meets their practical needs and fulfills their dreams. INFPs may drift in frustration, waiting for the perfect job to present itself, eventually feeling stuck or worried that they’re not living up to their potential. The question of whether to settle for a less-than-ideal position can weigh heavily on people with this personality type. Alas, there’s no such thing as a perfect job. Fortunately for INFPs, their creativity, independence, and sincere desire to connect with and help others can help them shine – and find fulfillment – in nearly any line of work.",
                "<b>A Place for Everyone: </b>Certain careers and vocations seem to hold a special allure for these personalities. With their curiosity and their love of self-expression, many INFPs dream of becoming writers. They might write novels, seek out interesting freelance niches, or even find themselves doing communications in a corporate field or for a nonprofit organization. Richly imaginative, INFP personalities can infuse even the driest of fundraising or marketing materials with new life. Although this personality type isn’t known for seeking the spotlight, they can find their life purpose in the performing arts. Sensitive to artistic beauty, some INFPs simply come to life in the worlds of music, drama, or dance. These personalities can draw from their inner depths to pull out exquisite interpretations of a creator’s work. INFPs may also create their own works as playwrights, composers, or choreographers. Whatever they do, INFPs want to feel that their work is helping others. It’s not surprising, then, that many people with this personality type choose careers that are focused on service, such as counseling, psychology, teaching, health care, social work, massage therapy, or physical rehabilitation. For these caring, supportive personalities, few things are more meaningful than seeing their work help change someone’s life for the better.",
                "<b>Finding Their Way: </b>INFPs are highly adaptable people, but they still might find it demotivating to work in high-stress, bureaucratic, or hectic environments. They can also become frustrated by workplaces that are highly critical or competitive. Conversely, workplaces that reward independence tend to be a good fit for INFPs, although they may appreciate some structure and oversight to help them avoid procrastinating and getting lost in thought.That said, people with this personality type don’t need ideal conditions to thrive professionally. INFPs want to live in tune with their values, in their careers as much as in any other aspect of their lives. They can put up with – and overcome – any number of challenges as long as they can pursue a sense of mission in their work."

Wherever they find themselves on the job ladder, they try to cultivate an emotional and moral connection to what they do – looking for reassurance that their day-to-day efforts are helping others in some shape or form. This desire to be of service colors how INFP personalities respond to authority in the workplace as well as how they express it.",
                "<b>INFP Subordinates: </b>As employees, INFPs tend to be loyal, upbeat, and considerate. They take pride in being honest and doing the right thing in all circumstances, and they feel gratified by pleasing others, from their bosses to their customers. This might be why INFP personalities feel the most motivated when they’re thinking up ways to help others, not worrying about checklists or bottom lines. People with this personality type thrive off of positive feedback at work. With their idealistic nature, INFPs often hold themselves to extremely high personal standards. When they receive encouraging words from their boss or their coworkers, it serves as the validation that they need to know they are on the right track. On the flip side, criticism can lead these personalities to shut down. When faced with punishing expectations or a highly negative boss, they may find it hard to get things done. And they find it equally difficult, if not more, if they have to stand up to their boss and challenge their opinions or direction. Overall, INFP employees enjoy having freedom and latitude. Their creativity and insight enable them to shake up old, ineffective ways of doing things – as long as they’re given the chance to speak up and make changes. That said, they tend to benefit from deadlines and clear expectations to keep them on track. Otherwise, people with this personality type might get caught up in procrastination, bouncing from one idea to another rather than settling down and crossing tasks off their to-do list.",
                "<b>INFP Colleagues: </b>INFPs value equality and fairness, so it’s no surprise that people with this personality type can feel stifled by workplace hierarchies. They prefer professional environments where everyone feels valued and is encouraged to share their ideas – no matter their job title. As colleagues, INFPs do what they can to make this egalitarian ideal a reality. In their quiet way, they can become the glue that holds their workplace together. Although their voice might not be the loudest, they are often admired for their insight, with coworkers routinely coming to them for advice. Pleasant and kindhearted, INFP personalities don’t like conflict, drama, or workplace politics. Instead, they try to act in ways that foster harmony and cooperation. When someone needs help, INFPs tend to pitch in without any expectation of praise or recognition.",
                "<b>INFP Managers: </b>As managers, INFPs are among the personality types least likely to act as if they’re in charge. They respect their employees as full-fledged human beings, not just as workers. Rather than make all the decisions themselves, INFP personalities often ask to hear their employees’ thoughts and opinions. In general, people with this personality type don’t micromanage. Instead, they keep their eyes on the big picture. They see it as their responsibility to support their employees, not to tell them exactly what to do and how to do it. Whenever possible, they encourage the people who work for them to develop their own ideas and use their own best judgment. There is a downside to this management style. Sometimes, INFP managers may struggle to set boundaries, drill down on inefficiencies, or offer criticism, even when it’s necessary. This can slow down their team and create needless stress, both for them and for their employees. At times, managers with this personality type may need to be strict for the good of their team – and the workplace as a whole."

With their unique gifts, these personalities can overcome all sorts of challenges and obstacles – and brighten the lives of those around them in the process. Yet INFPs can be tripped up in areas where idealism and altruism are more of a liability than an asset. When it comes to finding (or keeping) a partner, making friends, pursuing a meaningful career, or planning for the future, people with this personality type may need to consciously develop their weaker traits and gain new skills – even as they draw on their many strengths."

Thoughtful and idealistic, ENFJs strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. These personalities rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy. ENFJs are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring people with the ENFJ personality type a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves.",

But they rarely come across as brash or pushy, as their sensitivity and insight guide them to speak in ways that resonate with others. ENFJ personalities have not only an uncanny ability to pick up on people’s underlying motivations and beliefs but also a knack for understanding how others are feeling just by looking at them. At times, they may not even understand how they come to grasp another person’s mind and heart so quickly. These flashes of insight can make ENFJs incredibly persuasive and inspiring communicators. This personality type’s secret weapon is their purity of intent. Generally speaking, ENFJs are motivated by a sincere wish to do the right thing rather than a desire to manipulate or have power over other people. Even when they disagree with someone, they search for common ground. The result is that people with the ENFJ personality type can communicate with an eloquence and sensitivity that are nearly impossible to ignore – particularly when they speak about matters that are close to their hearts.",

The good news is that many people are grateful for this assistance and advice. After all, there’s a reason that these personalities have a reputation for helping others improve their lives. But getting involved in other people’s problems isn’t always a recipe for success. ENFJs tend to have a clear vision of what people can or should do in order to better themselves, but not everyone is ready to make those changes. If they push too hard, their loved ones may feel resentful or unfairly judged.

In their day-to-day lives, ENFJs reveal how seemingly ordinary situations can be handled with compassion, dedication, and care. For these personalities, even the smallest daily choices and actions – from how they spend their weekend to what they say to a coworker who is struggling – can become an opportunity to lead the way to a brighter future."

People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.",

Passionate: </b>ENFJ personalities brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.<br><br><b>4. Altruistic: </b>ENFJs are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change in both their personal lives and their professional pursuits. Their unwavering inclination toward fairness often compels people with this personality type to advocate for those who are unable to do so for themselves. Their joy lies in seeing those around them thrive, making their altruism heartfelt and sincere.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Charismatic: </b>Determined and inspiring, ENFJs often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they excel at engaging in conversation, captivating people’s attention, and rallying people together behind a common goal. ENFJ personalities also have a profound capacity for empathy that oftentimes causes the people they come across to feel truly seen and valued, further bolstering their natural allure.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Unrealistic: </b>Many ENFJs put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities try, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.<br><br><b>2. Overly Idealistic: </b>ENFJ personalities tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to ENFJs when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Condescending: </b>People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But at times, ENFJs’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately.<br><br><b>4. Intense: </b>When it comes to self-improvement, ENFJs are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, these personalities may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.",

As true optimists and embodiments of passion, ENFJs believe their soulmates are out there somewhere, and they won’t give up until they find them. These personalities rarely settle for anything that falls short of their ideals, and their romantic relationships are no exception. Although ENFJs may come across as outgoing or even a bit flirtatious, few of them are satisfied by fleeting attractions. Their standards are high, and they know it. In fact, this awareness might give people with the ENFJ personality type a deeper appreciation of just how rare and precious it is to feel a real spark with another person – and, in turn, just how rare and special it is when that spark grows into the steady flames of true, abiding love.",
                "<b>Moving Beyond the Dating Game: </b>When they fall for someone, they tend to fall hard – and they’re not coy about it. ENFJs are among the personality types that most readily express how they feel, so they often find themselves making the first move rather than playing games or waiting for reassurance that the other person feels the same way. In the dating world, their willingness to put themselves out there can be refreshing and perhaps a little unusual. This, along with the intensity of their passion, is incredibly appealing to many people. That said, because ENFJ personalities often make the first move, they may encounter their share of rejection as they search for a kindred spirit.",
                "<b>Making an Effort: </b>With time, many INFPs come to learn that true love doesn’t just magically happen – it takes compromise, understanding, and work. After all, no partner is perfect, and even the most beautiful relationships have their challenges. Fortunately, people with this personality type can find a great deal of joy in the effort that it takes to strengthen a relationship. When they fall in love, INFPs reveal just how much passion thrums beneath their quiet exteriors. Devoted and thoughtful, they often express their affection through written words, handmade gifts, or meticulously planned experiences that resonate with their partner’s interests. They also tend to respect their partner’s independence, aiming to accept their partner as they are. That said, these personalities also want to help their partner learn, grow, and pursue their goals. INFPs are always dreaming up ways to improve themselves and the world around them, and the last thing they’d want is for their partner to feel unhappy or stuck. Many people with this personality type dedicate themselves to helping their partner improve their life. While this is a noble goal, they must be sure to keep track of their own needs and make sure that their partner is really ready to change. Provided they do so, INFPs’ support and devotion can make all the difference in their partner’s life.",
                "<b>Dreaming Together: </b>From their first date to their 50th, these personalities don’t shy away from steering the conversation toward heavier topics. ENFJs don’t just want to find out what TV shows someone watches – they want to get a sense of their partner’s dreams and aspirations and the changes they hope to make to themselves and to the world. And if their relationship deepens to the level that these personalities truly seek, ENFJs take pride in supporting their partner to make good on these dreams. Some people with the ENFJ personality type carry this forward-looking perspective a step further, taking on their partner’s goals as their own. This can be problematic, to say the least. If they become overinvested in helping their partner, they may end up neglecting their own self-care, hobbies, and friendships. ENFJ personalities may also be at risk of pushing their partner to change their life in ways that they simply aren’t ready for. When ENFJs carry this too far, they often find that the pressure they put on their partner to “better” themselves backfires in one of two ways. Their partner may become insecure, fearing that they aren’t good enough as they are, or they may become angry, feeling resentful of the implication that they need to change. Either way, ENFJs must learn to encourage their partner to grow without pushing too hard.",
                "<b>The Long Haul: </b>Few personality types are keener than ENFJs to establish a loving commitment with their chosen partner. They take dating and relationships seriously. In fact, ENFJs are the most likely type to want to start a serious relationship with the person they fall in love with. Consequently, even in the earliest days of a relationship, these personalities tend to focus on long-term potential, and as the relationship matures, they want to do what it takes to bring that potential to fruition. This can be a beautiful thing. ENFJs care about pleasing their partner, and their sensitivity helps them tune in to their partner’s shifting moods and desires. As long as they don’t lose track of their own needs, people with this personality type can enjoy incredibly rewarding relationships that are founded on trust, mutual support, and honesty – and, of course, love."

It’s no surprise, then, that they are anything but apathetic about friendship. ENFJs put sincere, dedicated effort into staying close with their friends. For these personalities, friendships are far from expendable or insignificant – instead, they’re a key component of a life well lived.",
                "<b>A Wealth of Perspective: </b>Few personality types can match ENFJs’ sincere desire to get to know people. For these personalities, discovering someone’s quirks and opinions and hopes and follies is one of life’s purest pleasures. Most ENFJs can’t help but be fascinated by other worldviews, even those with which they wholeheartedly disagree. Encountering a wealth of perspectives is what keeps life interesting for these types. Consequently, ENFJs surround themselves with all sorts of friends and acquaintances. In fact, they are the most likely personality type to have more than one friend group for different aspects of their lives. From work friends to gym buddies to partying companions, ENFJs love to relax and unwind by spending time with friends, diving into a good conversation, and getting to know what makes their friends tick. That said, most ENFJ personalities find it difficult to respect anyone who takes shortcuts, disrespects others, or refuses to challenge the status quo. Instead, they find it easiest to connect with people who share their core ideals, particularly their commitment to doing the right thing and leaving the world better than they found it. It is with these closest friends that ENFJs truly open up, sharing their vulnerabilities and their most precious dreams for their lives.",
                "<b>Through Thick and Thin: </b>ENFJs can be among the best friends anyone could wish for. Kindhearted and trustworthy, people with this personality type dedicate incredible amounts of energy and attention to their friendships. They want their friends to feel not merely validated but supported, not merely heard but understood. They can also be trusted to show up in ways both large and small – whether by taking time after a grueling day at work to help a friend spruce up their resume or by putting together a weekend-long destination birthday party for a friend who needs a boost. Nothing makes ENFJ personalities happier than seeing the people they care about doing well, and few things could stop them from trying to help make that happen.",
                "<b>Finding Balance: </b>While ENFJs enjoy lending a helping hand, they aren’t always happy with the results. The truth is that some people don’t have the energy or the drive to take full advantage of their offers to help – or they simply might not want to. For example, their friend might ignore that resume advice, or they might decide to kick back and relax instead of using that new resume to send out job applications. When this happens, people with the ENFJ personality type may feel unappreciated, frustrated, or resentful. They may even become judgmental in an effort to push their friend forward – an approach that all too often backfires. Paradoxically, having a more flexible attitude can guide these types to support the people they care about even more effectively. As many ENFJs discover, the most enduring friendships are based not only on mutual growth but also on acceptance, compassion, and genuine respect."

As parents, they are guided by a deep sense of purpose. Specifically, ENFJs see it as their mission to help their children grow into their best, kindest, most capable selves. To do this, ENFJs strive to create a loving, encouraging, and supportive home life for their children. Parents with this personality type promote creativity and authenticity, freeing their children to speak their minds and be themselves. For them, one of the greatest rewards of parenthood is watching their children blossom into their unique personalities.",
                "<b>Life's Most Important Lessons: </b>But just because ENFJ personalities are compassionate and nurturing doesn’t mean that they adopt an “anything goes” mindset. Like all parents, these types occasionally pull rank and tell their children to do something “because I said so.” In their heart of hearts, however, ENFJs want to make sure that their children do the right thing out of understanding, not blind obedience. Fortunately, these idealistic, good-natured parents can explain the difference between right and wrong in ways that uplift and inspire their children. These types also tend to excel at setting clear, age-appropriate rules and boundaries so that their children understand the consequences of behavior that’s irresponsible or unkind. And just as importantly, ENFJ personalities teach by example, modeling the kinds of behaviors that they hope their children will emulate. People with this personality type aren’t merely disciplinary figures. ENFJs are compassionate guides that embody the values that they hope their children uphold, including genuine authenticity, fairness, and respect for different people and perspectives. Their leading by example often results in their children growing up with a remarkable appreciation for the diversity in the world and a purpose-driven outlook on life.",

They simply want to be sure that their children are on a path toward a meaningful, fulfilling life that makes good use of their potential. At times, however, their expectations may seem overwhelming to their children. Children of ENFJ personalities may sometimes feel that they need to earn their parents’ love by meeting their standards – standards that might seem impossibly difficult to reach. In these situations, ENFJs may need to reassure their children that they are loved for who they are, not what they do.",

As they mature, ENFJs’ children rarely lose sight of the genuine warmth, care, love, and encouragement that they received from their parents. These children tend to grow up with a deep appreciation for the lessons that have been woven into the fabric of their character, including honesty, empathy, accountability, and the vital importance of doing the right thing"

That said, they tend to feel especially motivated in positions where they can guide others to learn, grow, and become more independent. Many people with the ENFJ personality type gravitate toward careers with an altruistic purpose, such as social work, teaching, counseling, coaching, health care, or public interest law. Rather than fading into the background, people with this personality type are known for their leadership abilities, and they often find themselves in positions of influence. ENFJs can be found in public office and at the helm of all sorts of organizations – from nonprofits and religious groups to scrappy start-ups and corporate empires. ENFJs may also find themselves in jobs as consultants, advisors, and managers. Wherever they work, they rarely lose sight of their core mission: to improve people’s lives. These types intuitively pick up on the needs of their clients, customers, or employees, and then they draw on their creativity to meet these varied needs in innovative, unexpected ways. As a result, ENFJs are able to bring sincerity, integrity, and even idealism to jobs in sales, customer service, marketing, advertising, and product development.",
                "<b>Finding the Deeper Issues: </b>Focused and driven, people with the ENFJ personality type are always up for a good challenge. That said, certain challenges motivate them more than others. Work that is repetitive, isolated, or otherwise constrained can be frustrating for them, as these roles don’t allow them to exercise their vibrant creativity or make contributions that feel meaningful. These personalities want to see the impact they’re having, not to plug away at tasks all on their own. ENFJs feel fulfilled and energized by work that allows them to step back and reflect on the big picture. For these types, leaving a positive legacy is a key priority. This doesn’t mean that they have to solve a problem as grand as world hunger (although, knowing them, they certainly would like to). But many ENFJ personalities do use their professional energy to resolve at least some of the deeper issues that the people in their community are facing. Versatile and insightful, ENFJs bring a wealth of strengths to their career. At times, they may feel stuck or bored, wishing that their daily tasks could make more of an obvious difference in the world.

Not only do they push themselves to prove their merit and make a good impression on their managers but they also tend to strive to make a positive impact within their organization. Perceptive and dedicated, people with this personality type can take on multiple responsibilities with competence and good cheer. Unfortunately, some managers may take advantage of ENFJs’ work ethic by making too many requests or overburdening them with extra work. Although these personalities are more than capable of standing up for themselves, they may still accept all of these additional tasks in order to keep the peace and avoid letting others down.",

In fact, ENFJs are the most likely personality type to offer to help people in their network get jobs or make other beneficial connections. For these personalities, helping others succeed serves as a success in and of itself. ENFJs’ tolerance and easy sociability make it easy for them to relate to their colleagues. They work hard to foster equitable team environments where everyone – whatever their job title – can feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas. That said, ENFJs’ tendency to take charge may sometimes ruffle their coworkers’ feathers. With their strong drive to lead, these personalities may sometimes be tempted to make decisions or suggest changes that go beyond the scope of their authority – leading their colleagues to ask, “Hang on, who put you in charge?”",

As managers, ENFJs make the people who work for them feel not just motivated but also inspired. ENFJ managers tend to see each member of their team as a person with important gifts and unique potential. As a result, working for ENFJs can feel meaningful and exhilarating – it’s a chance to develop as a person and as an employee. That said, their idealism may prevent ENFJs from recognizing the real limitations of their employees. At times, managers with this personality type may give team members assignments that they simply aren’t ready for – an approach that all too often backfires.

With their lively, upbeat approach to life, ENFPs stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, they don’t just care about having a good time. These personalities have profound depths that are fueled by their intense desire for meaningful, emotional connections with others.",

They regularly use their natural curiosity and expansive creativity to try to better understand themselves and the complex dynamics of human relationships. And they are truly devoted to nurturing their relationships with and their understanding of the world at large. In their unique way, ENFPs’ introspective nature is driven by their imagination, wonder, and belief in things that cannot always be explained rationally. People with this personality type truly believe that everything – and everyone – is connected, and they live for the glimmers of insight that they can gain from these connections. They believe that how we treat one another really matters. In fact, ENFPs are the most likely personality type to believe in the concept of karma.",
                "When something sparks their imagination, ENFPs show an enthusiasm that is nothing short of infectious. These personalities can’t help but to radiate a positive energy that draws other people in. Consequently, they might find themselves being held up by their peers as a leader or guru. However, once their initial bloom of inspiration wears off, ENFPs can struggle with self-discipline and consistency, losing steam on projects that once meant so much to them.",

Seemingly in the blink of an eye, people with this personality type can transform from impassioned idealists to carefree figures on the dance floor. Even in moments of fun, ENFPs want to connect emotionally with others. Few things matter more to these personalities than having genuine, heartfelt conversations with the people they cherish. ENFPs believe that everyone deserves to express their feelings, and their empathy and warmth create spaces where even the most timid spirits can feel comfortable opening up. ENFPs need to be careful, however. Their intuition may lead them to read far too much into other people’s actions and behaviors. Instead of simply asking for an explanation, they may end up puzzling over someone else’s desires or intentions. This kind of social stress is what keeps harmony-focused ENFP personalities awake at night. ENFPs will spend a lot of time exploring different relationships, feelings, and ideas before they find a path for their life that feels right.

Moreover, their curiosity extends beyond simply seeking novelty. They also have a deep desire to understand how things work and why they are the way they are.<br><br><b>2. Perceptive: </b>To people with this personality type, no one is unimportant – which might explain how they can pick up on even the subtlest shifts in another person’s mood or expression. Because they’re so sensitive to other people’s feelings and needs, ENFPs can make full use of their caring, considerate nature.",

Excellent Communicators: </b>People with the ENFP personality type brim with things to say, but they can be caring listeners as well.

Good-Natured and Positive: </b>All of these strengths come together to form a person who is warmhearted and approachable, with an altruistic spirit and a friendly disposition. ENFPs strive to get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of acquaintances and friends often stretch far and wide.",

To maintain the peace, they may compromise on things that matter to them or allow others to treat them poorly.

Unfocused: </b>The thrill of a new project – especially one that involves collaborating with other people – can bring out the best in these personalities.

                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Disorganized: </b>ENFPs’ focus on the big picture and their love for exploring new ideas and experiences can sometimes overshadow their attention to everyday practical matters. Specifically, people with this personality type may try to avoid the routine tasks that they view as boring like household chores, basic maintenance, or paperwork. The resulting sense of disorganization can become a major source of stress in their life.<br><br><b>4. Overly Accommodating: </b>ENFP personalities feel called to uplift others, and they may find themselves saying yes whenever anyone asks them for guidance or help.

                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Overly Optimistic: </b>Optimism can be among this personality type’s key strengths. But ENFPs’ rosy outlook can lead them to make well-intentioned but naive decisions, such as believing people who haven’t earned their trust. This trait can also make it difficult for these personalities to accept hard but necessary truths – and to share those truths with others.<br><br><b>6. Restless: </b>With their positive, upbeat attitude, ENFPs rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside.

And they bring every ounce of this vibrant energy to their romantic relationships. Many ENFPs harbor a deep longing to share their life with another person. As a result, these personalities may feel a bit empty or uninspired when they’re single. While their dedication to relationships is admirable, ENFPs may need to guard against investing too much of their sense of self in their relationship status.",

These individuals shower their new flame with affection, trusting that the devotion and passion that they feel are real. Optimists at heart, ENFP personalities are undaunted by the practical challenges and inconveniences of a new partnership. This might explain why they generally don’t shy away from long-distance relationships. In their minds, physical distance is no match for the power of true love. Rather than focusing on potential issues, ENFPs sink into the joys of a relationship’s honeymoon stage, constantly looking for ways to prove their dedication and delight their partner. For better or for worse, not everyone can match this personality type’s ardor and intensity. Some people just need more space – whether physical, emotional, or both. If their partner’s enthusiasm doesn’t seem to match their own, ENFPs may find themselves wondering if they’re doing something wrong. And when the flames of romance start to flicker or wane as a relationship matures – as happens in nearly every longer-term relationship – ENFP personalities might worry that their devotion has been misplaced and the match isn’t meant to be after all.",
                "<b>The Mystery of Relationships: </b>ENFPs tend to be very affectionate and playful with their partner. People with this personality type consider physical touch to be an essential and effective way to communicate their love in their romantic relationships. Perhaps because they’re so unstinting with their affection, ENFPs can struggle with the mystery of why some relationships don’t work out. Shouldn’t love be enough to keep two people happily together – especially when one of those partners is as eager to please as ENFP personalities are? But, like everyone, people with this personality type need to remember that relationships are in all ways mutual – mutual interest, mutual growth, and mutual responsibility. As many ENFPs learn, the fate of a relationship has less to do with whether it was “meant to be” in some cosmic sense than with how partners treat and communicate with each other.",
                "<b>Cherished Ideals: </b>ENFPs approach their relationships with the highest of ideals. They long to know and unconditionally accept everything about their partner, just as they long for that person to know and unconditionally accept them in return. With this intense, all-in approach to love, ENFPs may feel more energized in the exciting, unpredictable early stages of a courtship than they do in established relationships. People with this personality type tend to revel in the thrill of exploring new ideas and experiences with their significant other. However, successful long-term relationships require more than just two people who enjoy discovering new things together. For ENFPs, navigating practical matters such as chores, budgeting, and social or family obligations can sometimes seem painfully unromantic. But unless these types take on their share of the responsibilities and help keep things running smoothly, they may actually create or amplify any stress in their relationship. Fortunately, ENFPs can find ways to balance their spontaneous, passionate nature with the stability and consistency that long-term relationships require. With their trademark sensitivity and goodwill, these personalities can transform even the most mundane tasks into a creative, heartfelt expression of love.",

                "With their natural vivacity, people with the ENFP personality type (Campaigners) are effortlessly sociable. They generally make friends wherever they go using their charm and their excellent communication skills to draw in an interesting and diverse social circle – something that these personalities take pride in. As friends, ENFPs are uplifting and supportive. They’re nearly always up for a little lighthearted banter – or a deep, heartfelt discussion about anything and everything. Moreover, they have a knack for making their friends feel seen, valued, and appreciated. Generous and authentic, ENFPs have much to offer in the realm of friendship. At times, however, they may struggle with a suspicion that they care more about their friends than their friends care about them – a suspicion that can leave these sociable, warmhearted personalities feeling more than a little lonely.",
                "<b>The Adventure of Friendship: </b>Imaginative and upbeat, ENFPs know how to transform even the most ordinary moments into a special occasion. And for these personalities, nearly any opportunity to spend time with friends is a special occasion. ENFPs cherish their friends, and they’d hate to take a single moment together for granted. As you might expect, ENFPs’ sociable energy can be a magnet for other outgoing personality types. But their warmth and sincerity draws all sorts of people out of their shells, and many ENFPs feel drawn to befriend those who are relatively shy or reserved. Attracted to depth and nuance, people with this personality type find it gratifying to watch someone gradually open up and reveal their innermost thoughts and feelings. And with their unique combination of sensitivity and enthusiasm, ENFP personalities can help quieter friends feel understood and accepted – and a little exhilarated.",
                "<b>In Too Deep: </b>From the outside, it might seem that friendship comes easily to people with this personality type – and to some extent, it does. But that doesn’t mean that ENFPs always experience the deep, meaningful relationships that they long for. Some people simply don’t want to open up emotionally in the way that these personalities crave. Others may turn out to be closed-minded or judgmental in ways that don’t match their values. To ENFPs, it can sometimes seem as if the rest of the world were satisfied with superficial, casual relationships. In these moments, they can’t help but wonder whether their deep longing for human connection is just too much for other people to handle. Their idealism can also cause issues within their close friendships. This personality type is known for going to great lengths to be caring and helpful. ENFPs take pride in being unfailingly generous with their energy, time, money, attention, and emotions. But, at times, these personalities may give so much to their friendships that they can’t meet their own needs. Unfortunately, even between the dearest of friends, this sort of imbalance can create resentment and misunderstanding.",
                "<b>Finding Balance: </b>While ENFJs enjoy lending a helping hand, they aren’t always happy with the results. The truth is that some people don’t have the energy or the drive to take full advantage of their offers to help – or they simply might not want to. For example, their friend might ignore that resume advice, or they might decide to kick back and relax instead of using that new resume to send out job applications. When this happens, people with the ENFJ personality type may feel unappreciated, frustrated, or resentful. They may even become judgmental in an effort to push their friend forward – an approach that all too often backfires. Paradoxically, having a more flexible attitude can guide these types to support the people they care about even more effectively. As many ENFJs discover, the most enduring friendships are based not only on mutual growth but also on acceptance, compassion, and genuine respect.",
                "<b>Making Life Spectacular: </b>Fortunately, ENFPs’ emotional sensitivity enables them to respond not only to their friends’ needs but also to their own. Once they learn to balance their desire to help others with their need to stay true to themselves, ENFPs can bring the full strength of their empathy, curiosity, and joy to their friendships. And the adventures that people with this personality type share with their friends are the stuff that a great life is made of."

            "Parenthood" => [
                "For people with the ENFP personality type (Campaigners), one of the great joys of parenthood is sharing their sense of wonder and inspiration with their children. Few things feel more rewarding to ENFP parents than seeing their child light up with curiosity about the world around them, take steps to discover how things work, and use their knowledge to help make society better. These parents do not merely want their children to survive in the world – they want to inspire them to change it. ENFP parents also work hard to ensure that their children feel accepted and worthy just as they are. Rather than pressuring their children to look or act a certain way, these personalities encourage their children’s creativity and self-expression. Drawing on their own ingenuity and creativity, ENFP parents guide their children to discover and embrace their unique passions and interests.",
                "<b>Balancing Love and Discipline: </b>Striking the right balance between respecting their children’s autonomy and enforcing discipline can sometimes be a challenge for ENFP parents due to their strong affinity for harmony and individual freedom. They might not always have the heart (or, as they may see it, the lack of heart) to enforce the rules and restrictions needed to provide structure and reinforce important boundaries. These personalities often worry that if they’re too strict a disciplinarian, they’ll compromise the loving bond that they have with their children. With time, however, many people with the ENFP personality type discover that having just enough structure can actually help their children thrive. Once they recognize this, these parents often learn to set guidelines in a way that’s loving but firm. In this light, enforcing appropriate rules can become yet another way that ENFP personalities express just how much they love and care for their children. ENFPs tend to radiate acceptance and compassion. As parents, they aim to become confidants who their children can open up to without fear of judgment. People with this personality type excel at creating safe spaces where their children can feel comfortable talking about their frustrations and their fears as well as their dearest hopes and dreams.",
                "<b>Go On, Spread Your Wings: </b>Throughout their children’s lives, ENFP personalities provide their kids with an almost overwhelming amount of love and support. But as children mature into adolescence, they naturally feel drawn to establish their independence. They may spend more time with their friends than with their family or experiment with views and ideas that are radically different from their parents’. Although they love the idea of their children becoming independent, ENFPs may sometimes feel that their children are pushing them away – something that can be profoundly hurtful for these personalities. They may be free spirits, but ENFPs are also sensitive to others’ feelings and expectations, and they may struggle not to take their children’s behavior personally. Fortunately, ENFPs’ compassion can help them understand and honor their children’s needs through every stage of development. Parents with this personality type have the wonderful ability to meet their children exactly where they are. This can help their children develop a strong sense of self and self-worth, enabling them to venture confidently out into the big, wide world, knowing that they have both themselves and their ENFP parent to depend on.",

                "Maybe I could…fly helicopters and be an oceanographer who writes songs and cooks?” People with the ENFP personality type (Campaigners) are known for having a wealth of ideas, interests, and hobbies – to the extent that they may struggle to fit everything that they care about into their life. It’s no surprise, then, that choosing a career path can leave these imaginative personalities feeling overwhelmed or scattered. ENFPs want to add value to the world, build community, facilitate learning, and express their creativity through their work. Consequently, they may feel pulled in multiple directions, uncertain of how to honor both their passions and their values while still keeping their options open and pulling in a steady paycheck. The good news? ENFPs can use their boundless curiosity and imagination to propel themselves forward in nearly any profession.",
                "<b>What Works for ENFPs: </b>ENFPs have a way of brightening the world around them – including their workplace. As true optimists, these personalities can usually find pleasure and gratification in nearly any job. They may even welcome the challenge of breaking through a grumpy coworker’s shell, making harried customers smile, or boosting the morale of a less-than-cheerful workplace. That said, people with the ENFP personality type are more likely to be fulfilled by work that meets certain criteria. First, they need to believe that what they do on a daily basis aligns with their core values. Second, most ENFPs feel best in jobs that use – and build on – their talents, both learned and innate. These personalities may feel that something is missing if they take on a career that doesn’t allow them to use and improve their people skills. ENFPs also tend to be most motivated in careers that offer learning opportunities and room for creativity – including the opportunity to experiment with side projects that catch their interest.","<b>What Works for ENFPs: </b>ENFPs have a way of brightening the world around them – including their workplace.

                "This explains why many people with the ENFP personality type are drawn to careers in nonprofits, public service, counseling, education, customer or public relations, hospitality, media and entertainment, and the service industry. Jobs in social media and communications can be an excellent fit for ENFPs as well, allowing them to balance creativity with a sense of human connection. ENFPs may also gravitate toward scientific and technical fields where they can have a positive impact, such as human health and environmental science",
                "<b>Letting Creativity Prevail: </b>For ENFPs, few things are as demoralizing as a job where every day is the same. Predictability and repetition can make people with this personality type feel not only bored but also a little disheartened. Although they benefit from a degree of structure and accountability, they may lose steam in work environments that rely on strict regimentation and hierarchy. ENFP personalities crave variety, and they love to ask questions. If they’re stuck focusing all of their energy on just one topic or project for too long, they tend to lose focus. To maintain motivation and their hallmark enthusiasm, they need to feel as if they’re both exploring new ideas and pushing boundaries. Any job that expects them to keep quiet and follow protocol is effectively turning two of ENFPs’ greatest strengths into liabilities. Fortunately, ENFPs’ irrepressible creativity is an asset in most work environments. With their vivacity and empathy, these personalities can turn each workday into an opportunity to learn something new and make the world just a little better – and they wouldn’t have it any other way."

They are passionate about brainstorming with their teams and tend to excel in positions of leadership due to their ability to infuse the workplace with positivity and encouragement. With their warmth and open-mindedness, ENFPs often find ways to make their workplaces more creative, inspiring, and caring – no matter where they are on the career ladder. Whether they’re a brand-new hire or a CEO, ENFP personalities feel happiest when they have the time and freedom to explore new ideas. And if they can explore those ideas alongside other people who share their excitement – well, that’s even better. Some personality types are sticklers for workplace hierarchies, but ENFPs see all of their colleagues as their equals. Sure, they may want to impress their boss, but chances are they want to make a good impression on everyone else as well.",
                "<b>ENFP Subordinates: </b>As employees, ENFPs often impress their managers with their creativity and adaptability. People with this personality type are happy to experiment with new ways of doing things and to change course when necessary. They also stand out as excellent listeners, always eager to consider others’ perspectives. Like any personality type, though, ENFP subordinates have their pet peeves. Chief among these is micromanagement. ENFPs care about doing a good job, and they often feel that they do their best work when they can move at their own pace and do things in their own style. Constant nitpicking from their boss can be seriously stressful for these exuberant personalities. That said, many people with this personality type do benefit from some direct management and oversight. ENFPs are notorious for skipping ahead to a new project before they’ve completed the last one. They love exploring new endeavors, but once a project’s allure begins to fade, they may find it difficult to stay motivated. In this spirit, these personalities may find it helpful to view check-ins from their boss as accountability and encouragement – in other words, teamwork – rather than micromanagement.",
                "<b>ENFP Colleagues: </b>ENFPs view the people they work with not just as coworkers but as friends. These personalities take a genuine interest in their colleagues, curious about what makes them tick. Their ability to relax and have fun will always make these personalities popular around the watercooler. But what sets ENFPs apart is how they can transform their popularity into natural leadership, inspiring their colleagues to band together in teams and collaborate to reach their goals. People with this personality type are always on the search for win-win solutions to any problem. They don’t want to succeed at others’ expense, and they rarely put down a colleague to make themselves look good. Instead, they give credit where it’s due and lavish praise on anyone who does a good job. Group brainstorms are their forte. ENFPs listen to other people’s viewpoints and suggestions not just with tolerance but also genuine excitement.",
                "<b>ENFP Managers: </b>ENFP managers don’t talk down to the people who work for them. In fact, managers with this personality type behave much like they did before they were in charge: They establish real connections with their employees, and they inspire by example rather than shouting orders from behind their desks. However, not everyone shares this perspective on leadership. In the absence of clear orders, some employees may feel that they are being expected to read their ENFP manager’s mind. Some teams may need strict deadlines and timetables in order to succeed in their projects. For ENFP personalities, it can be especially difficult to reprimand or fire employees – even those who deserve it. Unless they set boundaries and expectations, bosses with this personality type may end up disappointed or even taken advantage of by the people who work for them. Fortunately, ENFPs have the sensitivity and insight to recognize when their team needs more structure or discipline in order to thrive. And while it may not be easy, they can use their communication skills and empathy to handle even the most challenging workplace situations in a way that is kind and fair."

                "People with the <B>ISTJ personality type</B> (Logisticians) mean what they say and say what they mean, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through. With their responsible and dependable nature, it might not be so surprising that ISTJ personalities also tend to have a deep respect for structure and tradition. They are often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational settings that offer clear hierarchies and expectations. While ISTJs may not be particularly flashy or attention seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable foundation. In their families and their communities, people with this personality type often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical in even the most stressful situations.",
                "<b>A Life of Integrity: </b>People with the ISTJ personality type believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation – and that anyone who pretends otherwise is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own desires. Consequently, they rarely hesitate to take responsibility for their actions and choices. They are quick to own up to their mistakes, admitting the truth even if it doesn’t make them look good or if it makes other people uncomfortable. To ISTJ personalities, honesty and straightforward communication are far more important than showmanship. They’d rather satisfy their own conscience than lie to impress someone else. ISTJ personalities are also known for striving to meet their obligations no matter what. And they are often baffled by people who fail to hold themselves to the same standard. They can sometimes unfairly misjudge people who don’t match their rigorous self-control – suspecting that someone is being lazy or dishonest when that person might actually be coping with other challenges. While this can sometimes make ISTJ personalities appear rigid or unempathetic, their judgment often stems from their unwavering commitment to reliability and structure.",
                "<b>Picking Up the Slack: </b>ISTJs’ dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. But it can also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With their strong work ethic and sense of duty, they may routinely find themselves shouldering other people’s responsibilities. Even if they don’t complain about the situation, ISTJ personalities can end up exhausted or discouraged if they’re constantly expected – or take it upon themselves – to pick up the slack for their colleagues, friends, or loved ones. ISTJ personalities aren’t known for expressing their emotions readily, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t feel frustration or resentment when they’re pulling more than their weight. And unless they make sure that their relationships are balanced and sustainable, they may end up compromising the very stability that they feel called to protect. The good news is that, by learning to set appropriate boundaries and speak up when they’re overstretched, people with the ISTJ personality type can offer the world the full benefit of their many gifts, including their clarity, their loyalty, and their dependability.",

                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>1. Honest and Direct: </b>Integrity is at the heart of people with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians). Emotional manipulation, mind games, and lies of any kind all run counter to their preference for managing the reality of the situations that they encounter with plain and simple honesty.<br><br><b>2. Disciplined: </b>ISTJs embody integrity through both their words and their actions. Patient and determined, people with this personality type meet their obligations and keep their promises, period. They value structure, follow rules strictly, and respect authority, showcasing their strong will and dutiful nature.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Very Responsible: </b>ISTJs would rather power through and lose sleep than fail to deliver the results that they said they would. Loyal and reliable, they almost always fulfill their duties to the people and organizations that they’ve committed themselves to, and they do so on time and with strict adherence to whatever guidelines were set in place.<br><br><b>4. Calm and Practical: </b>None of their promises would mean much if ISTJ personalities lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship – they tend to keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Other people’s preferences might be taken into consideration in the process, but ultimately, their decisions are made with practicality in mind.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Organized and Effective: </b>The primary goal of any ISTJ personality is to be effective in what they’ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Clear rules and regulations help people with this personality type maintain order and work in a productive manner.<br><br><b>6. Research-Oriented: </b>ISTJs are proud repositories of knowledge, with an emphasis on procedures and techniques that enable reliable outcomes. This allows ISTJ personalities to apply themselves to a variety of situations with success, picking up and applying new data as needed to maintain functionality.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Stubborn: </b>The facts are the facts, and people with the ISTJ personality type tend to resist any new idea that isn’t supported by those facts. This factual decision-making process makes it difficult for them to accept that they were wrong about something – but anyone can miss a detail, even ISTJs.<br><br><b>2. Insensitive: </b>While not intentionally harsh, ISTJs often hurt more sensitive types’ feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. These personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Always by the Book: </b>ISTJs believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments tend to leave these personalities stressed and dissatisfied.<br><br><b>4. Judgmental: </b>Because ISTJs tend to highly value facts and empirical evidence, they are unlikely to respect people who disagree with proven information – especially those who remain willfully ignorant. When others disregard concrete evidence and instead rely on assumptions or emotions, ISTJs can become judgmental, viewing these individuals as irrational or misguided.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Prone to Burnout: </b>All this can combine to make people with the ISTJ personality type believe that they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, they sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can’t deliver. Since they’ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, ISTJs may then believe that the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.",

As creatures of habit, ISTJs tend to deeply respect the traditions that they were brought up with, and they hope to share their culture and their values with a partner who is open to exploring them together. While their reserved and structured nature can make dating ISTJs challenging, people with this personality type are truly dedicated partners, willing to devote tremendous thought and energy to ensure stable and mutually satisfying relationships.",
                "<b>Deeply Committed: </b>Blind dates and random hookups are not the preferred methods that ISTJ personalities use for finding potential partners. The risk and unpredictability of these situations has their alarm bells ringing, and being dragged out for a night of dancing at the club isn’t going to happen without some serious reservations. ISTJs much prefer more responsible, conservative methods of dating, such as dinner with an interested coworker or, in their more adventurous moods, a setup organized through a mutual friend. Their ideal dates will almost always include something that is familiar to these personalities, like going out to eat at their favorite restaurant. Anything outside of what is expected can cause ISTJs to feel stressed or uncomfortable – two things that don’t tend to nurture romance. People with the ISTJ personality type approach relationships, as with most things, from a rational perspective, looking for compatibility and the mutual satisfaction of daily and long-term needs. This isn’t a process that they take lightly, and once commitments are established, they stick to their promises to the very end. ISTJ personalities establish foundations, fulfill their responsibilities, and keep their relationships functional and stable.",
                "<b>A Reliable Heart: </b>ISTJ personalities can get so caught up in believing in their own correctness, in “winning” arguments that they thought were about facts, that they don’t realize that their partner may have viewed things from a perspective of consideration and sensitivity. Especially with more sensitive partners, this can be a huge challenge for their relationships. Ultimately though, ISTJs’ sense of responsibility and dedication set the tone, and they spare no effort in noting this distinction moving forward. While their staid approach may seem boring to some, there is an undeniable attractiveness to it. People with the ISTJ personality type embody a strong and quiet determination and reliability – traits that are rare among other personality types – that can benefit even the flightiest types, allowing them to stay connected to the real world while still exploring new territory.",

                "People with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians) are not spontaneous in their friendships. They are not talkative or particularly playful in their affection. What ISTJ friends are is loyal, trustworthy, honorable, and dependable. Others may come and go with the ups and downs of life, but ISTJ personalities stay by their friends’ sides no matter what, with a deepness of commitment that other types may not even believe is possible.",
                "<b>The Gift of Loyalty: </b>ISTJs are a very methodical personality type, so their loyalty isn’t given away lightly. Often slow to make friends, these personalities usually end up with a smaller circle. But they promise to show up for the people in their circle, and their promises are not easily broken. Expressing emotional affection isn’t one of ISTJ personalities’ stronger skills, but they nevertheless find ways to show it. As Socrates said, “To be is to do,” and ISTJs’ follow-through – their willingness to take action as a show of support – stands in for their words. But all of this sounds terribly somber, and indeed it only shows one side of this nuanced personality type and their approach to their friendships. The other side knows how to stop being quite so serious, and especially in the company of joyful and talkative friends, ISTJ personalities enjoy relaxing and having fun with a good discussion about work, life, and current events. People with this personality type don’t like conflict, and this applies to how they select their friends as well. Seeking out friends with similar principles and opinions, ISTJs most often befriend people who are likely to share their perspective and world vision. While they are unlikely to become friends with substantially different personalities – it simply takes too much energy to bridge the communication gap – ISTJs still recognize and appreciate others’ strengths and qualities.",
                "<b>Better Together: </b>In fact, as if to prove the point, ISTJs do sometimes become friends with people who are more spontaneous and imaginative. These are very much relationships built not on mutual understanding but out of respect for their mutual differences. ISTJ personalities will happily marvel at other people’s breadth of thought, being very much in tune with their own intelligence, while they themselves are regularly admired for their realism and dependability – something that others are often hard-pressed to find. Knowledge, as always, is the great equalizer.",

            "Parenthood" => [
                "People with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians) are often very comfortable taking on the role of being a parent and the responsibilities that come with it. ISTJ personalities’ sense of discipline and honor blend well with a tradition that has been in place since time immemorial: to raise one’s children to be respected, contributing members of a home and society at large. As with most commitments, these personalities do not take being a parent lightly and will make it their work to ensure that this tradition is upheld to the highest standard. This doesn’t always come easily for their children though, as ISTJs tend to be strict, with high standards and expectations. These parents establish stable, clearly structured environments for their children, always with an eye on helping them to develop a sense of place in society and to fulfill useful roles. All this loyalty, devotion, and structure can fall short, though, when ISTJs’ children need the warmth of emotional support. While people with this personality type can be sensitive in their own way toward those they care about, it’s hard for children to recognize this tough love for the love that it is. Often these personalities need to work on developing more empathy and understanding as their children grow and evolve throughout the different stages of their lives. Specifically, ISTJs might try to strike a better balance between rational purpose and the more ethereal sense of emotional well-being.",
                "<b>Leading by Principle: </b>ISTJ parents are strongly principled, valuing patience and hard work, qualities that children often struggle with. Nevertheless, their children are expected to meet these standards and share these values for their own good. This approach often bears its fruit in the long run, but people with this personality type must keep in mind that their approach creates natural barriers and distance that often leaves their children wondering if they’re on the same team. Taken too far or with mutual stubbornness, this may even set in as a permanent state in the relationship, something that both ISTJ parents and their children ultimately regret. It is best for them to embrace and hold to their own values – while also recognizing that each person has their own goals – and to meet their children halfway in attaining theirs. Combining their natural devotion and purpose with this flexibility in support of their children’s own vision leads to a sense of mutual respect and accomplishment that any ISTJ parent would be proud of.",

                "While many personalities may be comfortable with flexible work as consultants and sole proprietors, people with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians) are much more focused on building long-term, stable careers. That’s not to say that ISTJs can’t do that sort of work – many find themselves thinking about what’s on the other side of those cubicle walls – but what they crave is dependability, and that is reflected in their choice of work perhaps more so than in any other part of their lives.",
                "<b>A Steadfast Mind: </b>The facts support this, as the most common ISTJ careers revolve around institutions of respected tradition, authority, security, and established consistency. Careers as military officers, lawyers, judges, police officers, and detectives are all very popular among ISTJs. This makes sense, as they not only offer the stability that these personalities seek but are in line with their principles and their desire to be honorable in all that they do. ISTJs of course aren’t limited to these organizations – there are many other roles that utilize their reliability, objectivity, sharp eyes, and ability to maintain razor-sharp focus for long periods of time. When facts and logic are out of place, ISTJ personalities swoop in as the accountants, auditors, data analysts, financial managers, business administrators, and doctors that identify, report, and correct the issues at hand. Most of these careers have ISTJs working alone, which is usually their preference, but when teams are necessary, they are best defined by clearly outlined roles, responsibilities, and work environments. In fact, this personality type is the most likely to work best when they have specific instructions on how to complete a task. ISTJs have strong opinions about how things should be done, and if things are shuffled around too often, people with this personality type can become surprisingly vocal about their opposition. It’s important for them to remember that even the most traditional and stable career paths can and need to change as time goes by. It is much better to accept this with grace than to develop reputations as being enemies of new ideas.",
                "<b>The Backbone of Society: </b>People with this personality type may also struggle with the increasingly open and social requirements of modern work life. Often being somewhat unpracticed at sensing others’ feelings, ISTJs’ “just the facts” attitude can be downright alienating when it comes to more sensitive personality types. This applies not just to coworkers but to customers as well – service positions like retail sales and waiting tables, as well as more emotionally demanding careers such as psychiatry, are, generally speaking, a more challenging fit. The best career paths for ISTJ personalities tend to feature a trend: they place facts above feelings and allow ISTJs to uphold the hard standards that are the backbone of society. Rules are the basis for everything that people take for granted about modern life, from the social contract that smooths relationships to the laws that protect peoples’ most basic safety to the constitutions and treaties that govern nations. People with this personality type take on roles as the defenders of these ideas, in big ways and small, and are rightfully proud of it."

                "When it comes to the workplace, people with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians) are almost a stereotype for the classic hardworking, dutiful employee. In all positions, ISTJ personalities seek structure, clearly defined rules, and respect for authority and hierarchy. Responsibilities aren’t burdens to them. Rather, they are a sense of trust that has been placed in them – an opportunity to prove once again that they are the right person for the job. On the other hand, the change that comes with assuming those new responsibilities or in losing old ones is often a significant struggle for ISTJ personalities. This presents itself differently in different positions of authority, but it is one of their most significant challenges to overcome. Insensitivity is an ISTJ weakness as well, and it is something that people with this personality type might benefit from working on, as interpersonal skills tend to be a pivotal component of both personal and professional development.",
                "<b>ISTJ Subordinates: </b>ISTJs crave responsibility, which makes them the go-to subordinates for challenging tasks and unpopular projects. Often recognized for their impressive focus and attention to detail, these personalities can competently tackle any project that comes with a manual. On the other hand, this can make them reluctant to give up responsibilities even when they are overburdened or when there might be a better person for the job. Their stubbornness aside, or perhaps because of it, people with the ISTJ personality type are quite possibly among the most productive of subordinates – they respect authority and hierarchy and have no problem following orders and instructions. Punctuality is unlikely to ever be an issue both in terms of showing up to work on time and in terms of meeting project deadlines. While ISTJs may need clearly set steps and well-defined responsibilities, they are exceptionally loyal, dedicated, meticulous, and patient in completing their work.",
                "<b>ISTJ Colleagues: </b>Among colleagues, no one can be trusted more to ensure that projects are finished on time and by the book than ISTJ personalities. Quiet and methodical, they keep cool when the going gets tough – an approach that they generally expect their colleagues to share. Significantly different personality types, especially more emotional ones, baffle ISTJs with their need for emotional support and openness or their capacity for delivering something that appears to be half finished. To ISTJ personalities, either something’s been done right or it’s been done wrong, and sugarcoating it or walking away isn’t going to fix it. ISTJs value peace and security in the workplace, and the easiest way for this to happen is for them to simply work alone. Innovations, brainstorming, theories, and new ideas all disrupt this comfortable state, and it takes a great deal of respect on ISTJs’ part to acknowledge their validity. Once the details have been laid out and a plan of implementation established, though, people with this personality type are an indispensable part of the team in putting these ideas into practice.",
                "<b>ISTJ Managers: </b>ISTJs love responsibility and the power resulting from it. Pressing themselves hard to meet their obligations, people with this personality type regularly go above and beyond their duties, and they expect their subordinates to act with the same level of dedication. At the same time, ISTJs’ preference for doing things by the book, adherence to hierarchy, and general aversion to innovation makes their subordinates ride a very thin line when they do – stepping out of bounds must be backed up with solid facts and outstanding results. It is said that it is better to do first and ask permission later, but it’s difficult to say whether this applies to ISTJs, as they are very intolerant of their subordinates’ failures to meet their obligations – one of those obligations being sticking to the original plan. Believing that truth, at least as far as they see it, is more important than sensitivity, ISTJ personalities are capable of laying down hard criticism. And their willingness to make tough decisions can make perceived insubordination the final trespass."

                "Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as ISTJs (Logisticians). Counting on key ISTJ strengths like reliability and hard work, these personalities are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Their dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth. Yet people with the ISTJ personality type can be easily tripped up in areas where their practical and methodical approach are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, ISTJs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills. What you have read so far is just an introduction into the complex concept that is the ISTJ personality type. You may have muttered to yourself, “Wow, this is so accurate it’s a little creepy” or “Finally, someone understands me!” You may have even asked, “How do they know more about me than the people I’m closest to?”"

Hardworking and devoted, these personalities feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. ISFJs can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes. This is a capable, can-do personality type with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, ISFJs also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. These personalities are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives.",
                "<b>The Gift of Loyalty: </b>One of the greatest ISFJ strengths is loyalty. They rarely allow a friendship or relationship to fade away from lack of effort. Instead, they invest a great deal of energy into maintaining strong connections with their loved ones – and not just by sending “How are you doing?” texts. People with this personality type are known for dropping everything and lending a hand whenever a friend or family member is going through a hard time. ISFJ personalities tend to feel most energized and effective when they’re showing up for someone who needs their help. And their sense of loyalty doesn’t stop with their nearest and dearest – it often extends to their communities, their employers, and even family traditions. But the intensity of their commitment and desire to serve can have its downsides. Other people may take advantage of ISFJs’ helpful, hardworking nature, leaving them feeling burned out and overworked. And these personalities may feel guilty or stressed when they contemplate saying no or making changes – even necessary changes – to themselves, their relationships, or the way that they’ve done things in the past.",
                "<b>The Highest of Standards: </b>For ISFJs, “good enough” is rarely good enough. People with this personality type can be meticulous to the point of perfectionism. They take their responsibilities seriously, consistently going above and beyond and doing everything that they can to exceed others’ expectations. Despite their hard work and consistency, ISFJ personalities are still known for their humility. They rarely seek the spotlight for the things they do. But that doesn’t mean that they are okay with being unnoticed or unappreciated. While ISFJs tend to underplay their accomplishments, that doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy recognition – or that they’re fine with being taken for granted. Unless they learn to stand up for themselves, people with this personality type may find themselves quietly losing their enthusiasm and motivation, eventually becoming resentful toward those who just don’t seem to appreciate them.",

Thanks to their ability to remember the details of other people’s lives, they have a special talent for making their friends and acquaintances feel seen, known, and cherished. Few personality types can match their ability to choose just the right gift for any occasion, whether large or small. Dedicated and thoughtful, ISFJs find great joy in helping those around them build stable, secure, and happy lives. It may not be easy for people with this personality type to show up for themselves in the way that they show up for others, but when they do, they often find themselves with even more energy and motivation to do good in the world."

ISFJs strive for win-win situations, choosing teamwork over competition whenever possible.<br><br><b>2. Reliable: </b>Rather than working in sporadic, excited bursts that leave things half finished, ISFJ personalities are meticulous and careful. They take a steady approach, ensuring that things are done to the highest standard – often going well beyond what is required. Further, most ISFJs agree that sustaining discipline and reliability becomes easier with time.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Observant: </b>ISFJ personalities have a talent for noticing things, particularly about other people. They pay attention to the smallest details of what someone says and does, giving them unexpected insights into other people’s lives and emotions.<br><br><b>4. Enthusiastic: </b>When the goal is right, ISFJs apply all of their gifts to something that they believe will make a real, positive difference in people’s lives – whether that’s fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer’s day at work.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Hardworking: </b>ISFJs don’t just get their work done – they take pride in going above and beyond all of their tasks and responsibilities. People with this personality type often form an emotional attachment to the projects and organizations that they’ve dedicated themselves to, and they won’t rest until they’ve done their share – or more than their share – to be of help.<br><br><b>6. Good Practical Skills: </b>The ISFJ personality type offers the rare combination of an altruistic nature and hard-won practicality. They don’t just hope to help others. They take action – meaning that they’re more than happy to roll up their sleeves and do what’s necessary to care for their friends, family, and anyone else who needs it.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Overly Humble: </b>ISFJs are so concerned with other people’s feelings that they may refuse to make their thoughts known or to take any duly earned credit for their contributions. They often downplay their efforts entirely when they think that they could have done some minor aspect of a task better.<br><br><b>2. Taking Things Personally: </b>Although they might try to hide it, people with this personality type are deeply sensitive to others’ opinions, and they can be thrown off-balance if someone doesn’t appreciate, approve of, or agree with them. When they encounter criticism or disagreement – even if it’s well-intentioned – ISFJs may feel as if they’re experiencing a personal attack.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Repressing Their Feelings: </b>Private and reserved, ISFJ personalities tend to internalize their feelings, particularly negative ones. This can create misunderstandings in their relationships. Eventually, all of their repressed feelings and resentments may boil over in a sudden, uncharacteristic outburst of frustration.<br><br><b>4. Reluctant to Change: </b>ISFJs are among the personality types that struggle the most with change. Breaking with tradition isn’t easy for these steady personalities, who place great value on history and precedent. Even when change is necessary, they may wait until the situation reaches a breaking point before altering course.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Too Altruistic: </b>ISFJs’ giving, generous nature can leave them vulnerable to being taken advantage of by others. It can be hard for them to rock the boat and stand up to someone who isn’t pulling their own weight. In fact, ISFJs are the most likely personality type to say they would rather clean up someone else’s mess than confront them about it directly.",

Beneath their patient and demure exteriors, ISFJs thrum with passionate commitment and loyalty toward the people they love. At times, even these personalities themselves may be surprised by the intensity of their feelings – especially their fierce desire to protect and care for their partner. ISFJs’ emotions run deep – so deep that people with this personality type may struggle to find the words to express just how much their partner means to them. But they show their affection in a million little ways on a daily basis. Always eager to make their loved ones’ lives better and more convenient, ISFJs can transform even the most ordinary tasks – from cooking dinner to organizing a weekend trip – into a heartfelt gesture of love.",
                "<b>An ISFJ In Love: </b>Although generally a proactive, can-do personality type, many ISFJs struggle to take the initiative when it comes to dating. Asking someone out can be incredibly uncomfortable for these personalities, who tend to worry about not only rejection but also violating unspoken social rules. The bad news is that ISFJs can end up feeling stuck, wanting to embark on a relationship but waiting for another person to make the first move. When they do find themselves in a relationship, ISFJs are – in a word – committed. People with this personality type find great fulfillment in sharing their time, energy, and affection with another person, and as partners, they tend to be incredibly giving and supportive. They don’t take their relationships lightly, and they don’t give up easily – even when challenges inevitably arise. ISFJ personalities tend to have a realistic appreciation for the amount of effort that a healthy long-term relationship requires, and they’re more than willing to put in the work necessary to build a lasting bond with a person they cherish.",
                "<b>Soundness of Heart: </b>ISFJs’ pragmatic approach to life can sometimes shield the incredibly strong feelings that lie within their heart. It’s no surprise, then, that it can take these personalities a relatively long time to recover from the heartache of a breakup – or even a particularly painful disagreement. ISFJs give so much of themselves in their relationships that they can feel deeply hurt when they believe that someone isn’t offering them enough love, commitment, respect, and appreciation in return. Unfortunately, ISFJs may find it difficult to break off a relationship – even when things just aren’t working out. People with this personality type may hang on due to misplaced loyalty, a general fear of change, or the hope that they can somehow figure out how to change any problems for the better. It would be a mistake, however, to think of ISFJs as pushovers in their relationships. Although these personalities generally try to avoid conflict, they have clear and firm opinions and preferences on all kinds of subjects. And when they feel as if their partner isn’t respecting their wishes, all of their repressed frustration and disappointment may eventually boil over in the form of negativity, resentment, or heels-dug-in stubbornness. In their heart of hearts, however, what ISFJ personalities want most is to ensure their partner’s happiness and wellbeing. As long as they balance this desire with a healthy amount of attention to their own needs and aspirations, ISFJs can enjoy exactly the sort of enduring, impassioned relationships that they’ve always dreamed about.",

But while they value and even cherish their friendships, they don’t find it easy to bond with just anyone. ISFJs tend to be private and a bit protective of themselves. As a result, it can take them a while to open up to someone new. This explains why most ISFJ friendships don’t start as random encounters on a wild night out but rather through comfortable and consistent contact – for example, at school or at work. ISFJ personalities appreciate the opportunity to deepen their connection with another person over time, gradually sharing more and more of themselves.",
                "<b>Getting Along: </b>Deep down, most ISFJs long to be liked and accepted. This is a natural desire, and it helps explain why people with this personality type are known for being such thoughtful, reliable friends. ISFJ personalities care about what others think of them, so they strive to bring their best selves to all of their relationships, including their friendships. This trait tends to make ISFJs exceptional friends. If taken too far, however, it can lead them to fall into the trap of people-pleasing. Some personality types have no trouble expressing an unpopular opinion or posing an awkward question – but not ISFJs. These personalities are reluctant to rock the boat, whether that means asking a friend to pay back a loan or disagreeing with where everyone else wants to go for dinner. In most cases, this behavior stems from a fear of being rejected. While most ISFJs are perfectly comfortable having a small, tight-knit circle of friends, they hate the idea of risking the disapproval of even one of those friends. The problem is that, over time, people-pleasing can cause these personalities to lose touch with their sense of self and their ability to make decisions on their own terms.",
                "<b>Seeking Balance: </b>Few personality types can match ISFJs’ fervent desire to be there for their friends through thick and thin. Always ready to offer advice, help, and reassurance, these personalities take pride in the fact that people turn to them in times of need. In fact, ISFJs will even ignore their natural tendency to avoid confrontation for their closest friends, jumping to their defense when anyone calls their character into question or puts them in harm’s way. Showing up for their loved ones in any way that they can truly offers people with this personality type a sense of purpose in life. In return, ISFJs crave loyalty and respect – and, in an ideal world, a bit of recognition for all that they do. But even though many of these personalities crave validation and support from their friends, they tend to be too proud to ask for it, just as they may not be comfortable asking for the help that they need. Fortunately, with time, many ISFJs learn that anyone who takes advantage of their generous, altruistic nature isn’t a true friend.",
                "<b>An Inspired Bond: </b>People with the ISFJ personality type can become attached to their vision of how things “should” be. In the world of friendship, they may believe – consciously or not – that they should be completely selfless. But when they ease up on this expectation, balancing their friends’ needs with their own, they can bring the full magnitude of their gifts to their friendships. This helps ISFJs enjoy the sort of meaningful, enduring bonds that make life all the more worthwhile."

ISFJs bring their innate sense of dedication, reliability, and consistency into their parenting style, aiming to provide a stable foundation to help their children grow up to be capable, successful, and happy. But when it comes to parenthood, ISFJs aren’t just motivated by a sense of duty – they are also motivated by love, and the depth and power of this love can be nothing short of amazing. Many ISFJ personalities feel that parenting allows them to use their gifts of altruism, generosity, and patience as they work hard to guide a beautiful new soul into the world.",
                "<b>The Road to Independence: </b>Given that ISFJs value tradition and guidance, it’s no surprise that many of these personalities embrace clearly defined roles for parents and children. Rather than seeing themselves as their children’s peer or best friend, these parents view their role, and often rightly so, as that of a loving authority figure – someone who imparts wisdom and values, gently but firmly teaching their children the difference between right and wrong. It can be challenging for ISFJ parents when their children, in an effort to assert their independence, push back on this well-intended guidance and support. As part of their development, most children reach a point where they want to test boundaries, experiment with new ways of doing things, and make their own choices – and that sometimes involves going against their parents’ advice and values. This may not be difficult for these personalities to manage in the early years, but it can become more of a struggle once their children reach adolescence and young adulthood – when the decision-making stakes become much higher. ISFJs value stability, and they want to make sure that their children are setting themselves up for the “right” kind of future – one that includes security as well as happiness. If they worry that their children aren’t putting themselves on track for this kind of future, ISFJ parents can become deeply unsettled or even somewhat controlling.",
                "<b>An Abundance of Love: </b>Fortunately, ISFJ personalities aren’t known for losing track of just how much they love their children. It’s true that parents with this personality type may sometimes be heavy-handed in their efforts to steer their children in what they perceive to be a good direction. But even if their children end up going a different way, that doesn’t mean that ISFJs will stop loving them or trying to help them find their path to happiness. The truth is that parenting is far from easy for any personality type – not if they’re doing it right. That said, ISFJs have the advantage of being not just caring but also thoughtful and responsible in how they administer that care. Often seen as ideal parents, people with this personality type are able to offer their children stability, security, and – most importantly – an abundance of love and support."

Because of this, they are often seen as the backbone of their workplace. ISFJs are generally very reliable, hardworking, and always ready to lend a hand to those who need it. They take pride in getting the job done and getting it done well, rarely cutting corners or trying to avoid a time-consuming task. This unshakable work ethic, combined with a genuine desire to be of service to others, makes ISFJ personalities invaluable in a range of careers.",
                "<b>Shining Behind the Scenes: </b>Few personality types can match ISFJs’ deep appreciation of what it means to play a supporting role. Rather than seeking out the spotlight for themselves, they genuinely enjoy helping and uplifting others. It’s no surprise, then, that ISFJ personalities tend to seek out workplaces that are collaborative and team oriented rather than competitive and high pressure. With their natural humility, these personalities tend to feel especially fulfilled by careers that allow them to facilitate others’ growth, healing, and progress. ISFJs’ patience and ability to stay present in the moment enable them to be incredibly attuned to the needs of the people they are serving. Teaching is a prime example of a career that takes advantage of these important ISFJ strengths, as are speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, medicine, and social work. No matter what it says on their business card, many people with this personality type approach their work with an eye toward helping others in practical ways. ISFJs tend to excel at customer service, with a particular gift for listening to concerns, calming frustrations, and seeing things through to a clear resolution. The people skills that ISFJs call upon can also translate well into roles in human resources, IT support, hospitality, retail, office administration, library sciences, and pretty much any job that involves fielding and helping answer people’s questions.",
                "<b>Never Missing a Beat: </b>Some personality types lose steam in the face of a tedious, multifaceted task, but not ISFJs. Their attentiveness to detail is among their greatest strengths. Consequently, detail-oriented fields like law, accounting, data analysis, and research can be right up ISFJs’ alley. What’s especially notable, however, is how they stay connected to the human dimension of this work, rarely forgetting the impact that their spreadsheets and memos might have on real people. Despite their many gifts, these personalities are unlikely to demand recognition or ask for promotions, preferring to let their work speak for itself. Given their respect for tradition and security, ISFJs generally have no problem with the idea of moving along in a structured hierarchy, trusting that their bosses will promote them if and when the time is right. But even the most patient person can become frustrated if their contributions seem to be continually overlooked. When ISFJ personalities finally do take the leap into management roles, they often find that their strengths are extremely well suited to building a cohesive, productive, and effective team. People with the ISFJ personality type may find it hard to part ways with employers due to their innate loyalty, even if things just aren’t working out. But as long as they put themselves in a work environment that appreciates and takes full advantage of their many strengths and talents, ISFJs can use their determination, precision, and altruistic energy to do even more good in this world."

ISFJ personalities can always be relied on for their kindness and ability to listen carefully to concerns – and to find ways to resolve them.

Relied on and respected for their patience and commitment, people with this personality type really only need one reward for their work: the satisfaction of knowing that they’ve helped someone. And if that person expresses a bit of gratitude, so much the better. At times, though, ISFJs’ radical humility can hold them back. They tend to be unwilling to play up their achievements, often for fear of creating unnecessary friction or appearing to be a braggart. Unfortunately, this can make it all too easy for their bosses to overlook them when opportunities for promotion come along. ISFJs’ loyalty and dependability often makes them invaluable to their bosses. In fact, they are the most likely personality type to report getting along with their boss. This might be in part because, in general, these personalities can be trusted to carry out their tasks precisely and without complaint. But it is also because they are such thoughtful and warm individuals who are willing to put in the effort to get to know people. That being said, ISFJ personalities’ aversion to rocking the boat may make it difficult for them to correct or disagree with their bosses or coworkers, even when it’s necessary to do so in order to avoid wasted time and energy. Fortunately, with time, many ISFJs learn to express their opinions (and corrections) in a gentle, nonjudgmental way.",

Close-knit and supportive teams are what ISFJ personalities enjoy most, allowing them to express their altruistic spirit among people who rely on their dedication and warmth. These strengths can become drawbacks, however, as ISFJ personalities’ aversion to conflict and their desire to help can be abused by less scrupulous colleagues. Instead of only asking for help when they need it, some colleagues may heap extra work on their desks, knowing that ISFJ colleagues have a hard time saying no. Unless they learn to set boundaries, people with this personality type can feel overburdened, stressed, and taken advantage of.",

In fact, they tend to prefer taking orders over giving orders, but their interpersonal skills and work ethic actually lend themselves quite well to managing others. ISFJ managers tend to be warm and approachable, always willing to answer questions and always ready to step up and help. Having no real desire to exercise power over others, ISFJ personalities prefer to work alongside their subordinates, keeping things running smoothly and minimizing conflict. ISFJ managers care about efficiency and effectiveness, but not at the expense of maintaining a positive relationship with their subordinates. Change can be a challenge for bosses with this personality type – including the none-too-pleasant change of firing someone who isn’t working out. At times, ISFJ managers may sink a bit too much of their energy into an underperforming employee – but they’d much rather make this mistake than the mistake of giving up on someone who just needed another chance."

They will happily lead the way on difficult paths, and they won’t give up when things become stressful.",
                "<b>Leading by Example: </b>Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that must be earned, ESTJ personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it’s ESTJs. This personality type is aware of their surroundings and lives in a world of clear, verifiable facts. Their surety of their knowledge means that, even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. And their opinions aren’t just empty talk either, as ESTJs are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable. However, ESTJs don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if their partner or coworkers jeopardize them through incompetence, laziness, or, worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their disappointment. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, but it’s not because ESTJs are arbitrarily stubborn but rather because they truly believe that these values are what make society work.",
                "<b>A Greater Responsibility: </b>The main challenge for ESTJ personalities is to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual as well as that of the group and helps bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. That way, ESTJs really do have all the facts and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone.",

                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>1. Dedicated: </b>Seeing things to completion borders on an ethical obligation for people with the ESTJ personality type (Executives). Tasks aren’t simply abandoned because they’ve become difficult or boring. Often refusing to cut corners or shirk responsibilities, they showcase their dedication through their unwavering commitment to high standards. In fact, they tend to strive for perfection in most things that they take on in life.<br><br><b>2. Strong-willed: </b>A strong will makes this dedication possible, and ESTJs don’t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. They defend their ideas and principles relentlessly and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Direct and Honest: </b>ESTJs trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and people with this personality type return the honesty (whether it’s wanted or not).<br><br><b>4. Loyal, Patient, and Reliable: </b>ESTJs work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When ESTJs say they’ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies, and communities.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Enjoy Creating Order: </b>Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can’t be trusted when they are needed most. With this in mind, ESTJs strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures, and clear roles. They tend to exemplify this need for order in their home lives as well, as they are the most likely personality type to have a very structured schedule that includes fixed times for waking up and going to sleep.<br><br><b>6. Excellent Organizers: </b>A commitment to truth and clear standards makes ESTJs capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Inflexible and Stubborn: </b>The problem with being so fixated on what works is that they too often dismiss what might work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and ESTJ personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance.<br><br><b>2. Uncomfortable with Change: </b>ESTJs are strong adherents to tradition. When suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren’t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Judgmental: </b>People with the ESTJ personality type have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable, and their compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there is more than one right way to get things done. They do not hesitate to let people they disagree with know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right.<br><br><b>4. Too Focused on Social Status: </b>ESTJs take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues, and community, and while difficult to admit, they are very concerned with public opinion. These personalities can get caught up in meeting others’ expectations, failing to address their own needs.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Difficulty Relaxing: </b>This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult for ESTJs to cut loose and relax for risk of dropping the ball or looking the fool, even in good fun.<br><br><b>6. Difficulty Expressing Emotion: </b>People with the ESTJ personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy – they forget to express emotions and empathy. For example, a detour can be breathtakingly beautiful and a joy for the family, but this type may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly.",

            "Romantic Relationships" => [
                "People with the ESTJ personality type (Executives) are fairly unique in that their relationships don’t really change as they progress from the dating phase into more steady, long-term relationships and further into marriage. Because they value honesty and straightforwardness so highly, they are likely to be clear about who they are, what they’re like, and what their goals are from the start. And true to their reliable nature, ESTJs tend to stick with those goals and expectations into the long-term. So long as their partner is able to take them at their word and follow suit, theirs are bound to be extremely stable relationships.",
                "<b>A Steadfast Love: </b>This isn’t to say that there isn’t any growth, of course – character development is always a high priority for ESTJs, and each life goal is important. Rather, it’s that shifting moods, goals, and desires are unlikely to fundamentally alter the basis of their relationships. This may all sound a little stale, and indeed ESTJs are not spontaneous or unpredictable people, but they do very much enjoy taking their partner out and having fun. Social events and activities are their idea of a good time, and while they may rely on familiar people and places, they do bring lots of energy and enthusiasm, which helps keep things interesting. ESTJs excel at expressing their interest and commitment through simple, laid-back outings and gestures, but they tend to have a hard time expressing emotional intimacy in their relationships. Touchy-feely moments are few, as are verbal statements of love. This is usually fine, as ESTJ personalities find other, more tangible ways to express their affection. The problem is in recognizing the validity of those qualities in others rather than simply dismissing them as pointless or irrational, something that can be extremely hurtful if their partners are more sensitive.",
                "<b>The Limits of Rationality: </b>ESTJ personalities address conflict head-on with simple statements of fact – a very rational approach – but subtlety and emotional tact are sometimes sacrificed in the process. While their level-headed communication methods are appreciated by many people, for others they can be uncomfortable. For all their social skills, ESTJs can be especially bad at reading the emotional side of other people, and when it comes to their partner, it’s more important than ever to try to match their emotional vulnerability from time to time. ESTJs are people with strong principles and strong self-confidence. They use these qualities to protect their partner with admirable consistency. But people with the ESTJ personality type are also stubborn, with a firm belief in their rightness, and they can quickly damage more sensitive partners’ fragile feelings. With this in mind, it is often best for them to work on listening with an open heart and mind and trying to meet their partner halfway when things get tough.",

                "People with the ESTJ personality type (Executives) are strong, traditional friends who appreciate loyalty and shared values. Friendships with them are often defined by their mutual activities and routines – by external factors – more so than the sense of intellectual or mystical compatibility. But this in no way diminishes the relationships – ESTJs’ friendships of dependability and mutual interest can be powerful connections that endure life’s changes with immutable constancy.",
                "<b>Setting the Course: </b>Among their established friends, people with the ESTJ personality type show themselves to be outgoing and enthusiastic, always more than happy to bring others along for some healthy sport and outdoor activity. They sometimes get a little overbearing in their push for participation, but it’s just because they want everyone to have a good time. Their friends are never short on invites to social activities and events, from tickets to a local ball game, to a weekend camping trip, to a Sunday BBQ. ESTJs seek strong friendships founded on trust and loyalty (though loyalty to family does come first). Active and with quick minds, people with this personality type can’t ever be accused of not doing enough to fend off a little boredom. While they may not be carefree, ESTJs know how to play their part in making sure that their friends have a good time. The way that they establish and maintain their friendships does limit the pool though. They tend to seek out people who are similar to themselves, who share their respect for traditions and institutions. ESTJ personalities are naturally stubborn, and it can be hard for them to find enough common ground with people who constantly disagree with their principles and beliefs to really form those ties of friendship.",
                "<b>A Broader Reach: </b>ESTJs’ challenge in friendship isn’t about finding fun things to do or people to do them with but in finding diversity in their friends and activities. For all their community participation, they struggle immensely in even fully listening to differing opinions, let alone befriending people who consistently express alternate viewpoints. Whether about local political issues or the validity of a more emotional, idealistic disposition than they think is reasonable, people with the ESTJ personality type can make more of an effort to truly understand these alternate viewpoints. Exposing themselves to new ideas among acquaintances who think differently can do no harm – either people with the ESTJ personality type discover better ways and a stronger foundation or they gain all the more confidence in their beliefs for having successfully defended them. Just as they may think those loners who spend their lives in their basements playing video games need to get out more, ESTJs themselves need to make sure they get out of their own bubble of unchallenged opinions and beliefs. However, despite the challenges that might occur due to their more selective approach toward friendships, it is ESTJs’ consistency, honesty, and clear expectations that tend to strengthen the ties they hold with their friends. They are not only committed to but also protective of their social circle, dedicating the time and resources needed to maintain their bonds.",
                "<b>An Inspired Bond: </b>People with the ISFJ personality type can become attached to their vision of how things “should” be. In the world of friendship, they may believe – consciously or not – that they should be completely selfless. But when they ease up on this expectation, balancing their friends’ needs with their own, they can bring the full magnitude of their gifts to their friendships. This helps ISFJs enjoy the sort of meaningful, enduring bonds that make life all the more worthwhile."

            "Parenthood" => [
                "For people with the ESTJ personality type (Executives), the mantra of “hard work, tradition, respect” is best exemplified in their relationships with their children. In many ways, they are very strict. They are guardians of family traditions who have no trouble when it comes to enforcing the rules and standards they’ve established. Often seen as model citizens, they expect their children to uphold that image, continuing the example that they’ve set by being polite and respectful – insubordination is not tolerated. ESTJ personalities have a very responsibility-oriented view of life, a firm belief in the idea that one does what one can do in order to contribute to the family and community. This view is of course extended to their children, and as soon as they are able, their children are expected to contribute in their own way, by cleaning their plates and their rooms and going to bed on time – by maintaining the order of things.",
                "This inflexibility can become a challenge as their children grow into their more naturally rebellious years. ESTJs defend their own, and their relationships with their children are no different, but they expect their children to adhere to the structures that they’ve put in place to ensure that protection. People with this personality type enjoy creating secure, stable environments, and they consider it an affront to have those considerations rejected – again, insubordination is not tolerated. It’s not that they have wild, high-flying hopes of perfection for their children – ESTJs are down-to-earth people and simply want to see their children develop into respected, responsible adults. But these personalities also want their children to be strong-willed and capable, and that is something that can only happen when they have the chance to make their own decisions and the chance to face the consequences of those decisions, good or bad, with the love and support of their parents.",
                "<b>A Foundation of Honesty: </b>They may face challenges as their children learn to balance a growing desire for independence with the respect and adherence to the duties required of them, but people with the ESTJ personality type do have a clear advantage of consistency and direct honesty that never leaves their expectations ambiguous. It can be a tall order, but their children always know what they need to bring, and most will recognize and appreciate the dedication and hard work that their parents brought in return.",

            "Career Paths" => [
                "For people with the ESTJ personality type (Executives), career paths are often as clear and straightforward as they are themselves. Though there are many directions that they can choose to go, they almost always end up in situations where they have the opportunity to exercise their affinity for organization, structure, and follow-through. Providing further focus, ESTJs share a profound respect for tradition, stability, and security – qualities which lend themselves well to progressing along clear paths to increased responsibility and dependability.",
                "<b>Key Traits for Success: </b>ESTJs’ sense of loyalty often results in them staying with a single employer for as long as possible, and their reverence for established institutions often leads to work with well-respected organizations. Law enforcement, military service, hospitals, and prominent legal firms are all able to recognize their long years of service. People with the ESTJ personality type are the image of the model citizen, and they strive to maintain this ideal throughout their careers. This helps them move forward into management as well – these powerful individuals have many traits inherent to leadership, something that is often recognized regardless of their chosen industry. From the genuine enjoyment that they feel in organizing other people to their knack for clearly expressing their principles, values, and expectations, ESTJs are extremely effective managers. As the fearsome leaders they are, people with the ESTJ personality type loathe disorganization, ineptitude, laziness, and especially dishonesty, and when these values are crossed, they do not hesitate to let their disapproval show. But so long as everyone plays by the rules, ESTJs are incredibly efficient. With their love of structure and thoroughness, they leave a record of accurate, complete work that is on time and on budget, making them natural auditors, financial officers, and business administrators.",
                "<b>The Value of Hard Work: </b>Hard work and self-motivation are also strong ESTJ principles, which makes them excellent sales representatives, whether in basic retail positions, as part of an office team, or as independent agents. People with this personality type stick to projects until they’re finished, big or small, and they are organized enough to make any necessary paperwork a mere minor inconvenience to their clients rather than some baffling ordeal. These qualities combine to make the clear steps in advancement that they require in order to maintain a sense of accomplishment not just viable but almost inevitable."

            "Workplace Habits" => [
                "People with the ESTJ personality type (Executives) show clear and consistent tendencies, and these are especially visible in the workplace. Whether they are working as subordinates, among colleagues, or as managers, they create order, follow the rules, and work to ensure that their work and the work of those around them is completed to the highest standards. Cutting corners and shirking responsibilities are the quickest ways to lose this personality type’s respect.",
                "<b>ESTJ Subordinates: </b>ESTJ personalities are hardworking and do things by the book. Though sometimes stubborn and inflexible, especially when presented with ideas that haven’t been fully developed, they are generally open to learning methods as long as they are more efficient and effective than the old way of doing things. However, they are unlikely to do much experimenting on their own – adhering to stated responsibilities and fulfilling their duties is their primary concern. ESTJs are also well-known for their loyalty and dedication, but in some ways this is contingent on their respect. People with this personality type are willing to voice their opinions, especially in deciding what is and is not acceptable – if provided with sensible responses that address their concerns, they are often satisfied with that. But if they view their managers as illogical, dishonest, or cowardly in their methods, they can be uncomfortably honest, if still calm and level, in voicing their opinions on that as well.",
                "<b>ESTJ Colleagues: </b>ESTJs enjoy the hustle and bustle of well-organized workplaces. Honest, professional, and down-to-earth, they are great networkers who enjoy connecting with others to get things done. They will happily put in a call for a work colleague or network with someone they don’t know in order to be helpful and get the job done. But abusing this for advancement is unlikely, and is in fact something that they frown upon. People with this personality type tend to view shortcuts as irresponsible. They quickly lose respect for those who try to push forward by showing off or promoting bold but risky ideas, making relationships with more inspiration-oriented colleagues a challenge. ESTJs like to feel like they are a part of the team and a part of the greater organization that they work for. To make sure this happens, they are nearly always willing to accept criticism that can help to improve their effectiveness. They also always keep an eye on their surroundings to make sure that they and their team deliver the results that are expected of them.",
                "<b>ESTJ Managers: </b>ESTJ personalities take genuine pleasure in organizing others into effective teams, and as managers they have no better opportunity to do so. While sometimes overbearing, even micromanaging, their strong wills and community-focused mentality also serve to defend their teams and principles against diversions and cutbacks, regardless of who brings them. ESTJs project natural authority, but they sometimes expect this authority to be abided unconditionally, resisting change and demanding that things be done by the book. Whether their own book or the existing rules and traditions are used is subject to circumstances, but they do tend to rest on the security of tradition and precedent. Regardless, ESTJ personalities’ expectations are clearly expressed, leaving little room or tolerance for deviation from the original plan."

Known for their reliability and administrative skills, they are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Their dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth. Yet ESTJs can be easily tripped up in areas where their rational and practical approach is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, ESTJs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills."

These social individuals form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors. This doesn’t mean that they are saints or that they like everyone. In fact, they are much more likely to form close bonds with people who share their same values and opinions. But regardless of other people’s beliefs, ESFJ personalities still strongly believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them. Generous and reliable, they often take it upon themselves – in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together.",
                "<b>The Beauty of a Responsible Life: </b>People with the ESFJ personality type are altruists. They take seriously their responsibility to give back, serve others, and do the right thing. And they believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, ESFJs may find it difficult to not judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, they often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them or chooses to walk a path that they do not understand. With their definite views on right and wrong, these personalities tend to be on the opinionated side. But these opinions aren’t arbitrary – they’re often based on a deep respect for tradition. ESFJs know that everything they do affects someone else, and they trust that established laws, protocols, and social norms will help them navigate their everyday lives in a way that is considerate and responsible toward others.",

But make no mistake: they don’t just breeze through other people’s lives. Loyal to the core, they build lasting relationships, and they can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand – or a listening ear – is needed. In fact, knowing that there are people out there who rely on them and need them tends to fill the cups of these generous types. With their love of order and structure, ESFJs prefer planned events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers – and they’re happy to host in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly. People with this personality type put a great deal of energy into making other people feel special and celebrated, and they might take it personally if someone doesn’t seem to appreciate their efforts. For many people with the ESFJ personality type, one of life’s greatest challenges is accepting that they can’t control anyone else’s thoughts or behavior – not even those who are nearest and dearest to them.

They can tie too much of their identity to others’ expectations, losing a sense of themselves.<br><br><b>2. Inflexible: </b>ESFJ personalities place a lot of importance on what is socially acceptable and can be very cautious, even critical, of anything unconventional or outside the mainstream.

No other kind of relationship provides them with the same level of support and devotion. Consequently, the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely fulfilling for ESFJs. ESFJs take each stage of a developing relationship, from dating to everything thereafter, very seriously. Everything about their relationships is based on satisfying mutual needs. They set out to create understanding early on and to build mutual respect and support for each other’s opinions and goals as time goes on. Knowing that they are loved and appreciated can have a huge effect on ESFJ personalities’ mood and self-esteem.",
                "<b>A Tender Heart: </b>If they feel like the support that they crave isn’t there, such as when their partner delivers criticism, ESFJs can feel extremely hurt. People with this personality type dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. Nothing is more hurtful or depressing to them than to realize that their partner doesn’t respect their dreams or opinions. They can be surprisingly tough and tireless in the face of hardship, but they need to know without a doubt that their partner is behind them 100%. Unfortunately, less mature ESFJ personalities may lack the inner strength and wisdom to attract this in healthy ways. They can feel very lost without validation, compromising their own principles and values in exchange for their partner’s approval. This is a terrible trap – not only does it result in them losing touch with themselves but it can also too easily lead to being taken advantage of, which can further reduce their self-esteem. Another snare is their fixation on social status and approval – it’s not uncommon for their social circles and relatives to play a bigger part in their choice of dating partner than even their own values.",

While in their weaker moments they can sometimes use these observations to manipulate others, they are far more interested in maintaining strong relationships, and this is a great tool for doing so. As true altruists, ESFJ personalities almost always use their powers for good, encouraging and inspiring others. By and large, ESFJs are pleasant and sincere people.

There’s nothing quite as hurtful to people with this personality type as finding out that a trusted friend is critical of their beliefs or habits – except maybe being told so in a direct confrontation. Even though they are generally popular among the people they meet, ESFJs can greatly expand their circle of friends if they learn to be more receptive to other perspectives rather than making snap judgments and conclusions.

However, despite the challenges that might occur due to their more selective approach toward friendships, it is ESTJs’ consistency, honesty, and clear expectations that tend to strengthen the ties they hold with their friends. They are not only committed to but also protective of their social circle, dedicating the time and resources needed to maintain their bonds.",
                "<b>An Inspired Bond: </b>People with the ISFJ personality type can become attached to their vision of how things “should” be. In the world of friendship, they may believe – consciously or not – that they should be completely selfless. But when they ease up on this expectation, balancing their friends’ needs with their own, they can bring the full magnitude of their gifts to their friendships. This helps ISFJs enjoy the sort of meaningful, enduring bonds that make life all the more worthwhile."

            "Parenthood" => [
                "As parents, people with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls) have an excellent opportunity to display their warmth, affection, and dedication in ways that have a real and positive impact. Sensitive yet firm, ESFJ parents are able to establish rules and authority without being entirely overbearing, using their compassion and support to smooth over the occasional miscommunication or difference of opinion. From the start, they try to ensure that their children feel safe and happy. They enjoy the support that they are able to give their infants, who are utterly dependent on their care. Family being as important as it is to ESFJs, this is an incredibly rewarding start to the relationship.",
                "<b>Protective or Overprotective?: </b>ESFJ parents bring their strong practical abilities and organization skills into their parenting. They are highly efficient in planning their children’s schedules, keeping track of their progress in school, and managing household chores and duties. Their dependability and dedication make them incredibly hands-on parents who are physically and emotionally present in their children’s lives. As their children grow and begin to explore, ESFJ personalities’ love and care grows with them, but at times it can become overprotective. They don’t just keep their children safe physically but also socially, by arranging playdates, summer camp visits, and other activities. They may fill their kids’ schedules so much that their children aren’t free to make their own choices or the blunders that can lead to emotional growth and social independence. ESFJs value harmony and stability highly, and it’s often the case that they try to use indirect pressure to teach life’s lessons. When they are forced into a confrontation by their children’s blatant wrongdoing, though, these parents step in firmly and expect their words to be respected. Believers in traditional roles, parents with the ESFJ personality type tend to view the parent-child relationship in black-and-white terms, with their authority as final.",
                "<b>The Gift of Independence: </b>As their children grow into adolescence and begin to push away from their parents, these typically warm caregivers can take this transition personally. Feeling like they are losing their children, ESFJ personalities sometimes try to prolong dependence as long as possible. It’s important to remember that when grown children leave the home, it’s because their parents were successful in preparing them for the next phase of their lives – an accomplishment that these parents can be proud of. The children of ESFJ parents will always appreciate the sensitivity and warmth that they were raised with, and as time goes on and they have their own children, they will cherish the fact that those children have the benefit of grandparents who love and care for them unconditionally."

They are well organized. They enjoy bringing order and structure to their workplace, and they often work best in environments with clear, predictable hierarchies and tasks. Monotony and routine work are not a challenge for them, as long as they’re working in the company of others.",
                "<b>Altruistic Motivations: </b>Careers as administrators are a natural fit, allowing them to organize not just an environment but also the people within it. Their practical skills combine well with their dependability, making ESFJ personalities surprisingly good accountants – though they often prefer to be personal accountants, helping people and interacting with them directly, instead of corporate accountants crunching numbers in some back room. Purely analytical careers can feel too dull for ESFJs – unless they’re paired with human interaction and emotional feedback. Good listeners and enthusiastic team members, people with the ESFJ personality type are excellent providers of medical care and social work. Teaching is another great option, as they are comfortable with authority but are supportive and friendly enough to keep that authority from feeling overbearing.",
                "<b>A Helping Hand: </b>Being as altruistic as they are, ESFJs find it hard to be satisfied unless they know they’ve done something valuable for another person. This is often the driving force behind these personalities’ careers and career advancement, and it makes religious work and counseling particularly rewarding. Whatever they choose to do, ESFJs’ comfort with busy social situations and practical knowledge and skills come together to create people who are not just able to be productive and helpful but who genuinely enjoy it."

                "When it comes to the workplace, people with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls) have clear tendencies that tend to shine through regardless of their position. They thrive on social order and harmony. They use their warmth and social intelligence to make sure that each person knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to get done. They are comfortable with, even dependent on, clear hierarchies and roles, and whether subordinates, colleagues, or managers, ESFJ personalities expect authority to be respected and backed up by rules and standards.",
                "<b>ESFJ Subordinates: </b>With clearly defined responsibilities and a sense of purpose, ESFJs are patient, efficient, hardworking people who can be counted on to get their job done and to do it well. They respect the authority of their managers and even tend to admire their bosses, putting in the effort needed to learn from them what they can and stay on their good side. While people with the ESFJ personality type may struggle with too much freedom and improvisation, they thrive in workplaces with structure, safety, and guidelines. Routine tasks are not a problem for them, and their dedication and loyalty earn them the respect of their managers.",
                "<b>ESFJ Colleagues: </b>Teamwork is a concept that ESFJs have no trouble putting into practice. Often seeking friends at work, people with this personality type are almost always willing to lend a hand when and where it’s needed. Excellent networkers, they always seem to “know just the person” to bring a project together on time. On the other hand, they often need to work on a team – being stuck alone chipping away at paperwork for days on end just leaves them tired and unfulfilled. These individuals take pride in these qualities, which has the side effect of making them particularly sensitive when they come under criticism. When their suggestions and help are turned down, ESFJ personalities can take it personally. Already somewhat vulnerable to stress, rejections like these can be pretty demoralizing, and they may need their coworkers to make an effort to express their appreciation from time to time.",
                "<b>ESFJ Managers: </b>ESFJ personalities enjoy the responsibility that comes with organizing social situations, and the enjoyment they feel in managing other people translates well into management positions. As team leaders, they find ways to make everyone feel involved, uniting people and smoothing relations in order to get things done. At the same time, they have a strong respect for traditional power structures, and if after all their efforts convincing their subordinates to work together someone ends up challenging their authority, they can stress out, lose their temper, and just generally react badly. People with the ESFJ personality type are sensitive about their status and dislike conflict. They prefer situations where everyone knows their role. So long as expectations are clearly outlined, they are effective and enjoyable managers."

Known for their social and administrative skills, they are good at creating and maintaining a secure, stable and friendly environment for themselves and their loved ones. Their dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth. Yet ESFJ personalities can be easily tripped up in areas where their kindness and practical approach are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, ESFJs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills."

They are natural makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it and learning from their environment as they go. They find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, leaving them just a little bit better than they were before. ISTPs prefer to approach problems directly, seeking straightforward solutions over convoluted troubleshooting methods. People with this personality type rely heavily on firsthand experience and trial and error as they execute their ideas and projects. And as they do so, they usually prefer to work at their own pace, on their own terms, and without unnecessary interruptions. This is not a type who is inclined to socialize beyond what is necessary as they try to accomplish their goals. In fact, ISTP personalities generally find regular socializing to be taxing. And when they do decide to get together with people, they will almost always choose smaller, more meaningful interactions over superficial networking.",
                "<b>Direct and Decisive: </b>For all the mysteriousness heaped on them, with this type, what you see is what you get. Direct but reserved, calm but suddenly spontaneous, industrious but focused on their own priorities, people with the ISTP personality type can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. They can seem very steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions. Decisions made by ISTPs may largely stem from their rational nature and their sense of what feels practical for them at any given moment, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t get swept away by their passions from time to time. Once their flame is lit, they tend to commit their time and energy with an impressive intensity until another equally compelling, or perhaps more gratifying, opportunity arises. And when it does, people with this personality type have no qualms about walking away from projects or situations that seem unfruitful or drained of potential. One of the biggest issues that they are likely to face is that, because they often act out of haste, they might rub people the wrong way sometimes. ISTPs are not the type to sugarcoat their opinions or feelings. They tend to have a very straightforward communication style that is often misinterpreted as bluntness or a lack of sensitivity, but it is simply the way these genuine souls operate. ISTP personalities have no time for people-pleasing or unnecessary social niceties. With them, there is little need to question their motives.",
                "<b>Defying the Rules: </b>ISTP personalities are truly a unique bunch. At their core, they are authentic individuals who march to the beat of their own drum rather than adhering to societal norms and rules. Their opportunistic outlook and direct approach to life tend to create a rich tapestry of experiences and interactions for people with this personality type – some incredibly frustrating and others extremely gratifying. Guided by their knowledge and the evidence at their disposal, ISTPs navigate life by feel and inspiration, often stepping away from predefined routines to follow their instincts. They are unbound by convention, preferring to chart their own course in all that they do. In essence, people with the ISTP personality type live life freely on their own terms, valuing personal autonomy above most things. Weaving their way through social expectations, they still find a way to color outside the lines. Their journey might not align with broader norms, but therein lies the strength and beauty of their unique perspective. Finding an environment where they can coexist with people who understand their need for freedom, space, and unpredictability will give them many happy years.",

As hands-on individuals, they love readily engaging with their environment and transforming their observations into practical solutions.<br><br><b>2. Handy and Resourceful: </b>This personality type is very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, crafts, and skills. Novel ideas come easily to ISTPs, and they love using their hands to put them into action.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Spontaneous: </b>They are generally able to go with the flow and think on their feet. This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but ISTPs are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most.<br><br><b>4. Direct and Authentic: </b>ISTPs value straightforward and honest communication. They speak their mind without sugarcoating, reflecting their authenticity. This directness often fosters clarity in their relationships and helps them advocate for their wants and needs.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Independent: </b>Very self-reliant individuals, ISTPs thrive on regularly undertaking tasks alone, which helps them foster their creativity along with strong problem-solving abilities.<br><br><b>6. Grounded: </b>ISTPs have the uncanny ability to stay rooted in the present moment. With a keen focus on what’s happening now, this personality type is less likely to get swept up in hypothetical future scenarios or past regrets.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Unapologetic: </b>As easily as ISTPs go with the flow, people with this personality type can also ignore it entirely and move in another direction with little consideration for others’ preferences. If someone tries to propose a different direction, ISTPs can become quite blunt in their irritation.<br><br><b>2. Insensitive: </b>ISTPs rely on logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to come out quite right, if anything is even said at all.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Private and Reserved: </b>This personality type is notoriously difficult to get to know. They keep their personal matters to themselves and often just prefer silence to small talk.<br><br><b>4. Easily Bored: </b>ISTPs enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but they are much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things as novelty wanes. Once something is understood, they tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Independent: </b>While also listed as a strength, ISTP personalities’ independence can be a challenge in their social relationships, including in romance. Having someone else’s schedule – especially a social calendar – imposed on them is unlikely to sit well for long. Their tolerance can be quite low for having others take their time away from what they’d prefer to be doing.<br><br><b>6. Overly Skeptical: </b>ISTPs’ generally skeptical outlook can help them avoid unfounded assumptions, but unchecked skepticism may lead them to dismiss more subjective truths or unquantifiable aspects of the human experience. It can also lead to missed opportunities – they may not take risks or explore unfamiliar concepts due to a lack of definitive proof. Similarly, excessive skepticism may also strain social relationships due to perceived negativity and lack of trust.",

            "Romantic Relationships" => [
                "Dating people with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) is a tango, complex and interesting, with alternating detachment and genuine care, some frank conversation, and plenty of spontaneity and enjoyment of the moment. Nothing can be forced in ISTP relationships, but so long as they are given the space they need to be themselves, they will gladly enjoy the comforts of a steady partner.",
                "<b>An Independent Heart: </b>Early in dating, these individuals can be especially difficult to get to know. They live in the present, and they generally prefer partners who are also more focused on the practices of the present than the hypotheticals of the future or feelings of the past. If a potential partner doesn’t measure up, these personalities may simply walk away. They also need a great deal of personal space, both physically and mentally, and any attempts to control them or forcibly schedule their activities only heightens the risk of their departure. As their relationships progress, ISTPs’ partners tend to find that intimacy is one of the more accessible avenues to open emotional expression. It’s not that they don’t have feelings – they actually run quite deep and strong. They just conceal and protect those feelings partly because they are unsure of how to deal with and express them and partly because they tend to think people should deal with their emotional baggage privately.",
                "<b>The Subtle Art of Communication: </b>People with the ISTP personality type often leave things unsaid that they think are mutually understood. Attempts to push understood arrangements, even the relationships themselves, into open discussion in order to secure commitment, especially early on, are often met with something close to panic or disdain. Nothing is so acutely terrifying to them as knowing that there’s no way out. Every day is a new day, and ISTPs review their obligations from moment to moment. None of this should be taken too personally by their partners – it’s just how ISTPs’ minds work. People with this personality type live in the present, in a world of physical activities that engage the senses, and they just need to know that they have the freedom to be passionate about something one day and indifferent the next without being grilled on when they’re going to finish something or why they’ve “suddenly changed their mind.” That said, being a little more expressive and a little more comfortable with the idea of consistency and follow-through can go a long way in rounding out ISTP personalities.",

                "When it comes to how people with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) navigate their friendships, their social playbooks might seem a little quirky compared to the norm. ISTPs cherish alone time and personal autonomy much more than the average person does. Consequently, when they do decide to participate in some mingling, they can be very selective about who they engage with. They are like a well-kept secret – not everyone gets the privilege of being their friend.",
                "<b>Keeping It Spontaneous: </b>A lot of this selectivity comes down to them simply not wanting to be bound to any particular person or activity. Forcing them to constantly commit to scheduled activities is probably the quickest way to end a friendship with someone with the ISTP personality type. As long as everyone keeps things relaxed and flexible, though, their friendships can be rich and rewarding. ISTP personalities live in the present, enjoying whatever life brings, and feel no real obligation to shift course on account of others’ plans. If friends don’t want to do what ISTPs are doing, then they are free to go do their own thing, and they’ll hang out some other time. Sometimes their shifts in attitude can catch their friends flat-footed, but they are generally very direct about how they do and don’t want to spend their time. People with this personality type are talented when it comes to using their abilities, and they usually enjoy a little competition. This makes their hobbies, especially the more hands-on activities, especially enjoyable with a little company, and these are usually the basis for their friendships. They are also thoughtful, rational people. Being fairly creative individuals themselves, they often enjoy putting a new spin on their interests with people who they feel close to – but in the end, the point of sharing those ideas needs to be to take action. Musing and dreaming are well and good, but talk is cheap, and discussions on abstract or distant subjects can only hold ISTPs’ attention for so long before they decide to shift their focus to something they can do.",
                "<b>The Surprising Charm of Being Yourself: </b>People with the ISTP personality type are unusually popular, almost in spite of themselves. Their interesting hobbies and sharply pragmatic nature are attractive to a remarkably broad range of people. It’s getting beneath the surface to become their true friend that is the real challenge. They may have a lot of goodwill and friendly faces to call on but only a few people who they feel truly understand them.",

                "When it comes to parenting, people with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) give their children plenty of freedom and opportunity to do what they want – within sensible limits, of course. They generally feel that kids should be able to express themselves, even if it disturbs others in the process. It’s a big world out there. From the point of view of ISTPs, it’s meant to be explored and experienced without anyone trying to exert too much control over what other people can and can’t do – even if they’re kids. While often permissive, open-minded, and flexible, ISTP personalities still expect their children to use their freedom wisely. Nothing would be quite as perplexing to these parents as their children using that freedom to sit inside and watch television all day.",
                "<b>The World is Your Oyster: </b>Early in life, this attitude is tremendously beneficial for their children. At this age, every little thing is a miracle to be explored with every sense. Blocks don’t just have distinct colors and shapes, but smells and tastes too, and this sort of sensory exploration is right up ISTP personalities’ alley. As their children develop their motor skills, ISTPs are happy to stack those blocks right along with them. And as their children grow and acquire more complex abilities, ISTPs find great joy in showing them how to use real tools to build real things. If these personalities’ growing children share their basic qualities of spontaneity and passion for hands-on activities, they are happy to accompany them on just about any adventure. None of this is anything that gets forced on their children, though. ISTPs see little need in imparting their principles and interests on their children, instead just enjoying that their children enjoy doing things. Where parents with the ISTP personality type struggle most, as with their other relationships, is in emotional bonding. Emotional control is something that children learn and adapt to over years, and comparatively unemotional ISTPs are often left at a loss for what to do in the meantime. It takes a great deal of conscious effort on their part to be able to provide the sort of emotional understanding and support that their children need.",

                "People with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) are probably the hardest to pin down in many aspects of life, but especially in their career. They thrive on diversity and unpredictability, on wondering “What’s next?” every morning. This makes them one of the most mysterious personality types as well as one of the most versatile in the professional world. ISTP personalities are unique in that they have next to no time or patience when it comes to ideas or projects that cannot be applied sensibly in real time. They are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions. No other type is quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results. Their combination of curiosity and hands-on vigor makes people with the ISTP personality type excellent mechanics, equipment operators, data analysts, and forensic scientists – though they certainly aren’t limited to such professions.",
                "“Practical” is the word of the day. But it’s not the practicality of routine administration that ISTP personalities crave – they need work that holds their interest and gives them freedom. Highly structured environments leave these individuals bored and tired. Jobs that give them the space to work independently and according to their own timeline and that do not require too much schmoozing or public speaking are where they tend to thrive. Because they are usually firmly rooted in the present, ISTPs also tend to have a knack for crisis response positions, such as firefighters, paramedics, detectives, and pilots. Perhaps most important to ISTP personalities, though, is the feeling that they aren’t stuck. The freedom to wander, the freedom to declare their own schedule, their own responsibilities, their own environments – nearly every other consideration pales in comparison to the need to avoid inflexible commitments and stodgy colleagues. This need for freedom can be a significant hurdle to overcome in traditional employment opportunities and might cause them to consider entrepreneurship as an alternative option.",
                "<b>Embracing the Unpredictable: </b>Nearly any creative or constructive skill or interest can be offered on a freelance basis or on a business owner’s own terms, be it blogging, systems analysis, athletics, or driving. People with the ISTP personality type may need to work on their less developed long-term planning abilities and preference for rapid results in order to make this path work, but livelihoods can be made selling bits and crafts in their free time. It’s also possible to find more traditional work to satisfy these needs, so long as they are able to maintain their autonomy in one way or another. ISTP personalities have a natural skill with troubleshooting and a results-oriented focus. They understand that risk often leads to reward, and as long as they can use that understanding with maturity, they are highly desirable in any dynamic field or environment.",

But with some breathing room and a hands-on problem to solve, ISTPs can be some of the most productive people around. As with anyone, forcing people with this personality type into a mold that doesn’t fit just doesn’t work. Recognizing their unique perspective and gifts can lead to extraordinary results.",
                "<b>ISTP Subordinates: </b>As subordinates, what ISTP personalities crave most is a little wiggle room. They are happy to stick around with surprising loyalty as long as their employers and their managers don’t try to force them to commit to anything that can’t be undone the next day. Strict rules, guidelines, and formal agreements make them feel cramped and bored. If their habits or methods come under criticism or are forced to change, they can also be surprisingly mulish. Something that’s likely to make their day is a random, manageable list of things that need to be fixed or dealt with. ISTP personalities have a talent for conserving their energy for just such an occasion and can tackle such a laundry list with efficiency and ease.",
                "<b>ISTP Colleagues: </b>If you’re expecting people with the ISTP personality type to be the life of a party or the ones organizing social gatherings at work, you’ll be disappointed. Reserved but often bold, these individuals need space as they work. They generally prefer to keep to themselves and socialize only when necessary. That said, from time to time they enjoy peeking in on others’ work to see if there’s anything interesting going on. ISTP personalities are often much more liked by their colleagues than they would expect despite the fact that they are not naturally emotional or empathetic – or maybe because of this. However, they can still run into problems when their blunt way of communicating leads to misunderstandings or hurt feelings. Taking them at face value goes a long way.",
                "<b>ISTP Managers: </b>ISTP managers treat their subordinates as they’d like to be treated: with minimal talking and fairly loose boundaries. People with this personality type aren’t big on chattiness or emotional expression, and more sensitive types may see them as cold and distant – effusive praise and backslapping just isn’t in their nature. In fact, there isn’t likely to be a lot of feedback at all from ISTP managers, good or bad. But when problems do arise, they are great listeners who devise practical, fair, and impartial solutions."

For these types, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, they act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals. With their exploratory spirit and their ability to find joy in everyday life, ISFPs can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. Driven by their sense of fairness and their open-mindedness, people with this personality type move through life with an infectiously encouraging attitude. They love motivating those close to them to follow their passions and usually follow their own interests with the same unhindered enthusiasm. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, ISFPs tend to see themselves as “just doing their own thing,” so they may not even realize how remarkable they really are.",
                "<b>The Beauty of an Open Mind: </b>These individuals embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personalities thrive on strict schedules and routines – but not ISFPs. They prefer to take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for the unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves or with their loved ones. This flexible mindset makes ISFP personalities remarkably tolerant and nonjudgmental. They genuinely appreciate the diverse nature of the world, embracing people who may hold different opinions or practice unique lifestyles. It’s no surprise, then, that they rarely try to convince people to change who they are or what they believe in. That said, their go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides. People with this personality type may struggle to set long-term plans – let alone stick with them. As a result, ISFPs sometimes have a pretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, and they often worry about letting other people down. They may find that adding a little structure to their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel more capable and organized – without quashing their independent spirits.",

But make no mistake: they need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing with others. This alone time is what allows these personalities to reestablish a sense of their own identity – in other words, to reconnect with who they truly are. Creative and free-spirited, people with this personality type march to the beat of their own drum. It would be easy to assume that they don’t particularly worry about what others think of them, but oftentimes, this isn’t the case. ISFPs are thoughtful and perceptive, able to pick up on people’s unspoken feelings and opinions, and it can upset them if they don’t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated. Their emotional receptivity and genuinely sensitive nature might be part of the reason why they tend to be so accepting and forgiving of others. If any personality type believes in giving something (or someone) a second chance, it’s ISFPs. Despite the challenges that they may face due to their sensitivity, ISFPs live in the present, and they know that they don’t need to dwell on past hurts or frustrations. Rather than focusing on how things could be different, people with this personality type have an incredible capacity for appreciating what’s right about life just as it is. Everywhere they look, they can find sources of beauty and enjoyment that others might miss – and this perspective is just one of the many gifts that they share with the world.",

Charming: </b>People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.<br><br><b>2. Sensitive to Others: </b>ISFPs easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them establish harmony and goodwill and minimize conflict. Many people with this personality type are even able to perceive others’ emotions just by listening to their voices.",

Kind and Encouraging: </b>These individuals possess an innate kindness and fairness that fuels their understanding and empathy toward others and often helps them to create a safe space for others to express their thoughts and feelings. They generally adopt an encouraging disposition, always ready to cheer others on in the pursuit of their passions.<br><br><b>4. Imaginative: </b>ISFPs use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, their vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help people with this personality type in unexpected ways.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Passionate: </b>Beneath their quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When these personalities are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Difficulty with Structure: </b>Freedom of expression is often ISFP personalities’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression. This can make more rigidly structured contexts a challenge.<br><br><b>2. Unpredictable: </b>ISFPs dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in their romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Easily Stressed: </b>People with the ISFP personality type live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, they can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.<br><br><b>4. Difficulty with Technical Problem-Solving: </b>ISFPs are not the type to build, repair, or try a hands-on approach when faced with technical issues. Their preference for observation over direct, practical involvement often holds them back from dealing effectively with mechanical or technical problem-solving.",

Fluctuating Self-Esteem: </b>It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with ISFP personalities’ strengths of sensitivity and exploration. Their efforts are too often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. These individuals can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.",

                "People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) can be quite mysterious and difficult to get to know. While very emotional individuals, they guard this sensitive core carefully, preferring to listen than to express. They focus instead on their partner, with little interest in dictating the mood of a situation with their own feelings. While this can sometimes be frustrating, if they are accepted for who they are, ISFPs prove to be warm, enthusiastic partners. As their relationships blossom, their partners come to find vibrancy and spontaneity to be par for the course. This personality type may not be a great long-term planner, preferring to let their partner take the lead when it comes to logic and strategy, but they almost never run out of things to do in the present. Caring and loyal, ISFPs love finding ways to surprise their partner in fun little ways. There’s also a sense of practicality to their unpredictability – if anyone is going to cancel a planned trip to stay home with a partner who suddenly got the flu as a gesture of affection, it is ISFPs. Spending time with their partner is something that these personalities really enjoy, and they want their partner to know that they are cared for and special.",
                "<b>A Tender Heart: </b>For ISFP personalities, it’s important for their partner to make it clear that their love and attention is valued. They are very unlikely to ask for a direct thank you, but it can really hurt their feelings if they don’t feel seen and appreciated. Such expressions don’t have to be verbal – ISFPs believe in actions more than words – but it’s crucial that they know their feelings are shared. On the other side of the spectrum, there are few types more vulnerable to criticism and conflict, and it’s necessary to provide a certain level of emotional support. If they do feel appreciated, they are more than happy to reciprocate in any way they know how. People with the ISFP personality type are very sensual. They may be shy in public, but alone with a partner they trust, the masks come off – few people get to see this side, and it’s always a pleasant surprise.",
                "<b>Love From The Soul: </b>Feelings and emotions underpin every aspect of their relationships, alongside not just a tendency toward, but a need for, fresh possibilities. ISFP personalities are not to be forced into anything, and rushing long-term commitments is a sure way to scare them off. If they can’t feel excited wondering, “What’s next?” every morning, they may find themselves wondering, “What’s the point?” Still, developing some skill with planning can be a healthy area of growth for people with the ISFP personality type. Learning to be a little more comfortable with voicing their feelings and communicating more clearly is something their partner can also help with.",

They are the friends who are there to cheer you on during your highest highs and offer a shoulder during your lowest lows. Their adeptness at picking up on emotional cues and understanding feelings allows them to be highly empathetic friends who provide a reassuring presence and a listening ear in times of crisis or confusion. In friendship, ISFP personalities are some of the most laid-back, spontaneous people around. They won’t bog things down with arguments or structured long-term plans. The here and now is what’s important. They love spending time with their friends doing casual, fun activities.",
                "<b>Enjoying Life Together: </b>ISFP personalities believe in actions, not words. This passion for action is a blessing for them, since it helps them get past their shyness in meeting new people. ISFPs are generally very reserved and sensitive – much more so than most. It takes time to build enough trust with new friends to the point where they feel comfortable opening up and being themselves. However, when they’re with friends they trust, they know how to relax, shedding rules, traditions, and expectations in favor of just enjoying themselves. People with the ISFP personality type are happy to get along with just about anyone, but potential friends need to ease up on being too judgmental or demanding. If new acquaintances start things out by explaining, “You’d do way better if…” it’s unlikely that they will ever be close – ISFPs just take these remarks too personally for comfort.",
                "If their friends keep things supportive and easygoing, ISFPs are usually happy to return the favor with added warmth and laughter. They might even propose some spontaneous adventures along the way, making their friendships exciting and filled with unique shared experiences. Consequently, people who prefer safe, structured environments might end up struggling in these friendships – especially if they lecture these spontaneous personalities on how they’re living their lives. As with any criticism, those friends are free to do their own thing and to leave ISFPs to do theirs. Overall, lots of personal space and freedom are essential to people with the ISFP personality type. As much as they value the freedom to shape their own lives, they also respect their friends’ autonomy. They rarely impose their views on others, which contributes significantly to the comfortable space they form in their friendships. There’s really no better friend than ISFPs for dropping the pretenses and enjoying low-stress fun."

While no one is ever completely prepared for the undertaking of becoming a parent, these types’ natural warmth, practicality, and relaxed nature help them to settle in quickly and appreciate every moment of joy and hardship that comes with raising a child.",
                "<b>Finding Joy in the Everyday: </b>ISFPs’ greatest strength is arguably the joy they take in being with and helping their loved ones. Practical needs are taken care of from day one, and their children can always count on something exciting to do or to learn every day. ISFP parents might surprise their children with spontaneous camping trips or an unplanned arts and crafts session on a quiet afternoon. They are not restrictive when it comes to the things their children want to explore, believing that learning and growth often lie outside structured routines. Throughout parenthood, ISFP personalities love spending time with their kids and enjoy engaging in activities that center on quality time. Impromptu trips, home improvement projects like repainting bedrooms, or simply baking some treats together are all likely to become fond memories for their children. None of this is to say that ISFP parents are overbearing – in fact, they are one of the most relaxed personality types there is when it comes to parenting. They believe that the only way to really have their children grow up to be open-minded and well-balanced people is to let them explore and experience new things, make mistakes and learn from them, and to always know that they’ll be able to come home at the end of it. The freedom that people with the ISFP personality type grant their children comes with risks too, since it demands a certain level of maturity from the children themselves. Some lessons are harder than others. These can also be hard lessons for ISFPs, since they are more sensitive than most when it comes to their lifestyles or parenting being criticized. For these individuals, nothing’s quite as unpleasant as an, “I told you so.”",
                "<b>The Power of Love: </b>As their children grow into adolescence, ISFPs might struggle to accept the sometimes-drastic changes that come with the teenage years. These personalities need to know that their work and effort are appreciated, something that teenagers aren’t well-known for expressing. Children typically make an effort to distance themselves at that age, and private individuals or not, ISFPs need to know that their loved ones are by their side. In the end though, ISFPs are so much less likely to create the kinds of divides that other, more rigid personality types sometimes build between themselves and their children. There’s always going to be some pushback from teens and tweens, but with such warm, caring parents, their children can always rest assured that they know where home and hearth are."

Wealth, power, structure, advancement, and security, while all fine in their own right, are often second to their greatest need: creative freedom. ISFPs crave a tangible outlet for their imagination, a chance to express their idea of what works. While navigating their career path, ISFP personalities bring their distinctive blend of ingenuity, adaptability, and emotional intelligence to the table. Their preference for practical application of skills, coupled with their ability to think outside the box, tailor them for careers that appreciate innovation and spontaneity. With their unique perspective and simple desire to be themselves, ISFPs are natural artists, musicians, photographers, and trainers, as well as designers of all stripes. Setting up shop on websites like Etsy is far more alluring to these personalities than the confines of nine-to-five administrative work in some fluorescent cubicle.",
                "<b>Free Spirits at Work: </b>People with the ISFP personality type loathe sitting idle in colorless, unchanging environments. They are free souls and need flexibility, opportunities for improvisation, and immersive work that engages the senses. Consistent with their open-mindedness, they are not afraid to change career tracks if their current path doesn’t feel right. They venture down unpaved paths and prefer to live in the moment, believing that the here and now is what matters most. That said, ISFP personalities may struggle with long-term planning and decision-making. This could make career progression a bit convoluted, as they tend to prioritize immediate experiences over distant outcomes. Moreover, ISFPs often feel that they have little control over processes like retirement planning – they can’t predict the future, so it does no good to worry about it now. Right?",
                "<b>Looking to Tomorrow: </b>This mindset can hold people with the ISFP personality type back from many good careers, such as coaching, counseling, and teaching, which require long-term planning and often extensive certifications to get started. It takes a great deal of energy for them to maintain focus on a single goal like that for so long, but it can make the day-to-day so much more rewarding for the rest of their lives. An easier route revolves around freelance and consulting work in just about any industry that these personalities enjoy. Whether organizing charity events, working with hospitals to make patients’ stays more pleasant, or creating their new craft, ISFPs always seem to find a way to make the world a little more joyful and beautiful – and to make a living in the process."

Button-down environments that revolve around tightly held traditions and strictly enforced procedures are unlikely to appeal to them. Spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around, ISFPs just want a chance to express those natural qualities and to know that their efforts are appreciated.",
                "<b>ISFP Subordinates: </b>People with the ISFP personality type generally prefer to receive orders over dishing them out. They aren’t well-known for their long-term focus, but their spontaneity and creativity help them add color and novel perspectives to the tasks they take on. Moreover, they are usually open-minded and willing to incorporate feedback. In order for them to really thrive, they need clearly defined goals coupled with personal autonomy and a supportive work environment. If this balance can be made to work, ISFPs show themselves to be eager learners and passionate problem-solvers, especially if they get to deal one-on-one with other people or to tackle a problem solo. These personalities are humble, even shy, and unlikely to put themselves on the spot by volunteering their help. But they do love to feel appreciated, and if assigned a task, they work hard to earn that appreciation.",
                "<b>ISFP Colleagues: </b>ISFPs feel most comfortable among their peers. Working with equals and giving some advice in order to solve practical problems is right where these personalities like to be. While they may exhaust themselves if their role requires an excessive amount of social interaction, they are otherwise quite charming and have excellent networking skills. ISFPs are tolerant and friendly and usually just do what needs to be done regardless of whether their colleagues pull their own weight. Their supportive and caring nature makes them a comforting presence in stressful times. At the end of the day, though, ISFP personalities are sensitive and need to know that these efforts are appreciated in one way or another. It’s important for peers and superiors to provide feedback in a constructive, considerate manner.",
                "<b>ISFP Managers: </b>The position that feels most unnatural to people with the ISFP personality type is management. They are not a domineering type and take no real joy in exerting control over others, planning long-term goals, or disciplining unsatisfactory behavior. But just because it feels a little strange doesn’t mean that they aren’t good at it. Their sensitivity allows them to be great listeners, helping them to align their subordinates’ personal motivations with the task at hand. They also give their subordinates the freedom to do what needs to be done to solve what needs to be solved on any given day, and these personalities are likely to dig into that work right alongside them. This gives ISFP managers a marked style of inspiration and cooperation. They are usually well-liked."

Known for their kindness and artistic skills, they are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. ISFPs’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth. Yet ISFPs can be easily tripped up in areas where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, people with this personality type need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills."

They tend to be on the competitive side, often assuming that a competitive mindset is a necessity in order to achieve success in life. With their driven, action-oriented attitudes, they rarely waste time thinking about the past. In fact, they excel at keeping their attention rooted in their present – so much so that they rarely find themselves fixated on the time throughout the day. Theory, abstract concepts, and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep ESTP personalities interested for long. They keep their conversations energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. They often leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go rather than sitting idle and preparing contingencies and escape clauses.",
                "<b>Diving Right In: </b>ESTPs are a bold and brave bunch who are not afraid to take chances or act on their impulses. They live in the moment and dive into the action with an open mind and outward confidence. People with this personality type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills but because it’s so stimulating to their minds. They tend to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus responses. This makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for ESTPs. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart, and they can do well there, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that these personalities typically enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end – something that creates more exciting opportunities. Also challenging is that to ESTPs, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment that few school instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and it can earn these personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the troublemaking, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, ESTPs are a force to be reckoned with.",
                "<b>The Path Less Travelled: </b>With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, ESTPs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. They use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions even if it makes other people uncomfortable. ESTPs are as direct and straightforward as they come. People with the ESTP personality type are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing, and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and excitement everywhere they go.

What’s fun for ESTPs is finding ideas that are actionable and drilling into the details so they can put them to use. If a discussion is completely arbitrary, there are better uses for their time.",

This isn’t something that they actively seek – they just have a knack for making excellent use of social interactions and networking opportunities.</b>",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Insensitive: </b>Feelings and emotions come second to facts and pragmatism for people with the ESTP personality type. Emotionally charged situations are awkward, uncomfortable affairs, and blunt honesty doesn’t help here. They often have a lot of trouble acknowledging and expressing their own feelings as well, preferring not to dwell on heavy topics or the past for too long.<br><br><b>2. Impatient: </b>ESTPs move at their own pace to keep themselves entertained. Slowing down because someone else “doesn’t get it” or having to stay focused on a single detail for too long is extremely challenging for them.",

These personalities sometimes intentionally combat boredom with extra risk.<br><br><b>4. Unstructured: </b>ESTPs see an opportunity – to fix a problem, to advance, to have fun – and seize the moment, often ignoring rules and social expectations in the process.

                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. May Miss The Bigger Picture: </b>Living in the moment can cause ESTPs to miss the forest for the trees. People with this personality type love to solve problems here and now – perhaps too much. All parts of a project can be perfect, but the project will still fail if those parts do not fit together.<br><br><b>6. Defiant: </b>This type won’t be boxed in. Repetition, hardline rules, and sitting quietly while being lectured at are things that ESTP personalities don’t normally enjoy. They are action oriented and hands-on.

They just don’t usually place too much value in labeling their relationships, and they tend to go with the flow when it comes to their love lives, making ESTPs truly thrilling dating partners. These personalities love new ideas and the occasional philosophical discussion – but they need to be topics that can be explored through action together, not just idle talk. There’s musing about the causes and effects of epidemic obesity, and there’s training for a marathon together to promote healthy living.",

They are bold in their courting attempts, rarely hesitating to flirt openly even when others are present. Their natural charm and popularity often make them a magnet for potential partners. When coupled with their general indifference toward rejection, ESTPs tend to have an acute sense of self-assuredness that helps them seamlessly navigate the uncertainties of dating. As time passes, it can be challenging for them to move their relationships to deeper, more emotionally intimate levels. Easily bored, ESTP personalities seek constant excitement – sometimes even intentionally exposing themselves to risk if they feel stuck. If their partner isn’t able to keep up, ESTPs may need to establish a more independent relationship dynamic that allows them more freedom. With the right mindset, this can pair beautifully with a deeper commitment to a long-term partner.",

Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, they love to be the center of attention. ESTP personalities have an enviable imagination and an invigorating sense of spontaneity that tends to keep people on their toes. They love exploring interesting ideas, both in discussion and by going out and seeing for themselves, which means that ESTPs always seem to have some fun activity hidden up their sleeves. At the same time, they are easygoing, tolerant, and charming, making them naturally quite popular.",

There is little difficulty for them here – they seem to get along with just about everyone and to make new friends wherever they go. ESTPs live in the moment, and as a naturally confident personality type, they don’t worry much about what others think of them. This attracts friends who share their attitude and zest for life. While not opposed to long philosophical discussions, and often enjoying the intellectual exercise, ESTPs are unlikely to develop friendships based solely around one-on-one discussions about global economic challenges or the role of religion in politics. Straightforward to the point of being blunt, people with this personality type call it like they see it, and an honest opinion in debate is a sure thing.

They have a natural curiosity and spontaneity that is perfectly matched to the wonder and insatiable desire to learn that young children have.",
                "<b>Freedom to Explore: </b>ESTPs love hands-on activities. This means that their children usually don’t have to stand around waiting for someone to play catch with them or to help them build a model for school. Sports, hiking, and other practical, hands-on hobbies are all welcomed and encouraged. At the same time, given their aversion to rules and schedules themselves, ESTP personalities aren’t likely to forcibly enter their children into different kinds of clubs and teams. If their kids want to play softball, great – if not, well, they’ll just find something else to do. ESTPs give their children freedom. They encourage them to use their own judgment (especially with the minor stuff) and to follow their hearts – to heck with what other people think. These personalities keep a close enough eye on their kids, using that knack for picking up on even the slightest changes in others’ moods and habits, that they can step in with extra guidance when things start to go wrong. ESTP personalities do have one significant parental challenge though: Feelings tend to be seen as a bit of an irrational distraction, rather than a tool for expression and connection. If their children happen to be more sensitive, this can be a source of tension between these parents and their children. Frank honesty isn’t always the best solution to a child’s temper tantrum or a teenager’s relationship problem.",
                "<b>Focusing on Connection: </b>Still, ESTPs often find that parenthood gives them all the motivation that they need to work on their sensitivity and emotional attunement. Through shared activities and experiences, these parents can create healthy, genuine bonds with their children, gaining a deeper knowledge of their children’s unique needs and dreams and ways of being in the world. People with the ESTP personality type have the added benefit of direct and understanding relationships – their children won’t feel so much like they have to hide their mistakes and challenges, the paragon of parent-child communication."

            "Career Paths" => [
                "When it comes to career options for people with the ESTP personality type (Entrepreneurs), “action” is the word of the day. They think on their feet and are great at making quick decisions in the heat of the moment. At the same time, they’re affable individuals who always seem to make friends and connections wherever they go. Popularity and solid networking can be huge assets in the working world, and ESTPs have no problem using these people skills to their advantage. This social intelligence, combined with their natural boldness and improvisational skill, makes sales, business negotiations, marketing, and even acting – any tense, competitive environment – a great fit for ESTPs. These personalities trust themselves to make the right call. Risks, big and small, are a part of life, and they don’t sit around waiting for some boss at the top to tell them what to do. This can get ESTPs into trouble, but often enough it’s exactly what’s needed and can boost them up the career ladder just as well.",
                "Restrictions, rules, highly structured environments – these are great ways to drive people with this personality type crazy. ESTPs live life on their own terms, and this makes them brilliant businesspeople and freelancers. These roles also allow them to delegate the more tedious aspects of work – the accounting, meticulous research, and so forth – to those better suited. But even though ESTPs prefer positions that give them the freedom to make their own schedule decisions, they are not likely to enjoy working from home every single day. They much prefer to be out in the world surrounded by others in any work that they do. ESTPs are curious, energetic people with a taste for action. There are those who analyze and manage the logistics of public safety resource distribution, and there are those who drive the ambulances, patrol the streets, and save lives with their own two hands – they are the latter. They are highly observant yet impatient, enabling them to take in the whole of a situation at a glance and then act. Any emergency response role is great for ESTP personalities, whether it be as paramedics, police officers, or soldiers.",
                "<b>The Thrill of the Game: </b>This quality of living in the moment and craving immediate results for their efforts translates well into another field: sports. The thrill of competition, of pushing themselves to the physical limit to rack up just one more point for the win can have no comparison for ESTPs. Whether they are on the field as athletes themselves, coaching from the sidelines, or commentating from high above, people with the ESTP personality type revel in well-honed team effort and a well-executed plan, and any of these positions makes a fine line of work for them.",

            "Workplace Habits" => [
                "In just about any environment, the workplace included, it’s pretty easy to spot people with the ESTP personality type (Entrepreneurs). Boisterous and spontaneous, fun-loving and sometimes a little crass, ESTPs love tackling problems as they arise and telling great stories about their solutions afterwards. Naturally, some positions work better with these qualities than others, but these are adaptable individuals who can find a way to make just about any situation a little more interesting.",
                "<b>ESTP Subordinates: </b>Their most challenging position is the one that most people have to start out in: as subordinates. While perfectly capable of exercising restraint on their own terms, ESTP personalities hate having others’ rules and regulations foisted upon them. They are known for their experimentation, improvisation, and quick thinking – if they’re not allowed to use these qualities and have to check in with a supervisor for every little thing, they’ll be bored and frustrated. ESTPs know well that risk equals reward, and they’ll gladly skirt more mundane tasks in favor of something a little more exciting in the hope that it catches someone’s attention. A plaque and a bonus go a long way for people with this personality type. Getting ahead by the tenets of staid reliability, quiet helpfulness, or mere seniority isn’t their way – ESTPs move forward by sheer force of personality in a well-handled crisis.",
                "<b>ESTP Colleagues: </b>As colleagues, people with the ESTP personality type have a work hard, play hard mentality – as long as everyone else is pulling their weight, they’ll gladly pull their own and have a great time doing it. Charming and popular individuals that they are, networking comes naturally to ESTPs, and these qualities make it easy for them to get along with just about anyone. At the same time, if they see a colleague as incompetent or, worse, lazy, they usually don’t hesitate to let them know. Emotional sensitivity is not their strong suit. ESTP personalities are very observant and well tuned to changes in their colleagues’ habits and moods – unless they themselves are the cause of distress.",
                "<b>ESTP Managers: </b>Management positions are where ESTPs are usually most comfortable, as they often give them the most flexibility. Rules and traditions are a bother for people with this personality type – they’d rather try a bunch of new ideas with a chance of getting things done faster or better than have to pay attention to “the way things have always been done” or subordinates’ comfort with experimentation. This can make for a chaotic environment, but their inspiring and enthusiastic personality makes them well-suited to handling such a thing. ESTPs enjoy living in the moment. Rather than some broad, intangible future accomplishment like “making customers happy,” they set clear, measurable, and attainable goals that keep things on track day-to-day. They keep their eyes on the finish line, but they get there step by step."

                "Few personality types are as charming and attractive as ESTPs (Entrepreneurs). Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present, they are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. ESTPs’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth. Yet ESTP personalities can be easily tripped up in situations where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, ESTPs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills."

                "If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is people with the <B>ESFP personality type</B> (Entertainers). They get caught up in the excitement of the moment and want everyone else to feel that way too. No other type is as generous with their time and energy when it comes to encouraging others, and no other type does it with such irresistible style.",
                "<b>Living with Passion: </b>ESFP personalities are inclined toward putting on a show for others and generally appear to be very comfortable in the spotlight. However, it is not their love for being the center of attention that drives this sense of confidence but their knack for sensing what’s appropriate in certain situations. They have an uncanny ability to mirror the behaviors of those around them. ESFPs truly enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends. People with this personality type would almost always choose to be with friends over spending time alone. With their unique and earthy wit, they love soaking up attention and making every get-together feel a bit like a party. It’s not just talk either – ESFPs tend to have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, they have an eye for fashion. Knowing what’s attractive the moment they see it, they aren’t afraid to change their surroundings to reflect their personal style. This type is naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease. Though it may not always seem like it, these personalities know that it’s not all about them – they are observant and very sensitive to others’ emotions. Often the first to help someone talk out a challenging problem, ESFPs happily provide emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, they are more likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address it head-on. This personality type usually loves a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring.",
                "<b>A Spontaneous Spirit: </b>The biggest challenge they face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Complex analyses, repetitive tasks, and matching statistics to real consequences are not easy activities for people with the ESFP personality type. They’d rather rely on spontaneous opportunities or simply ask for help from their extensive circle of friends. It is important for ESFPs to challenge themselves to keep track of long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake – there won’t always be someone else around who can help to keep an eye on these things. ESFPs recognize value and quality, which on its own is a fine trait. In combination with their tendency to be poor planners, though, this can cause them to live beyond their means, and credit cards are especially dangerous. More focused on leaping at opportunities than in planning out long-term goals, they may find that their inattentiveness has made some activities unaffordable. ESFPs are welcome wherever there’s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun – and there’s no greater joy for these personalities than to bring everyone else along for the ride. They can chat for hours, sometimes about anything but the topic they meant to talk about, and they share their loved ones’ emotions through good times and bad. If they can just remember to keep their ducks in a row, they’ll always be ready to dive into all the new and exciting things that the world has to offer, friends in tow.",

            "Strengths & Weaknesses" => [
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>1. Bold: </b>People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) aren’t known for holding back. Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, they don’t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing.<br><br><b>2. Original: </b>Traditions and expectations are secondary to this personality type, if a consideration at all. ESFPs love to experiment with new styles and constantly find new ways to stand out in the crowd. Not stopping at mere outfits, they inject stylistic creativity into their words and actions too. Every day is a performance, and they love to put on a show.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>3. Positive and Enthusiastic: </b>ESFPs are known for their zest for life and infectious enthusiasm. They naturally exude the kind of positivity that lights up a room and draws people to them, and this often translates into an engaging charisma that can inspire those around them. They tend to approach life and its multitude of experiences with an open mind, ready to immerse themselves in the new, the delightful, and the unexpected.<br><br><b>4. Hands-on and Observant: </b>To ESFPs, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. They prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about “what-ifs.” With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that ESFP personalities are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes.",
                "STRENGTHS:<br><br><b>5. Excellent People Skills: </b>More so than things, though, ESFPs love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For these personalities, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with.</b>",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>1. Sensitive: </b>ESFPs are strongly emotional and often vulnerable to criticism – they can feel like they’ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably their greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light.<br><br><b>2. Conflict Averse: </b>ESFP personalities sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what’s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>3. Easily Bored: </b>Without constant excitement, people with this personality type often find ways to create it themselves. Risky behavior, self-indulgence, and the pleasures of the moment over long-term plans are all things that ESFPs get into a little too often.<br><br><b>4. Poor Long-Term Planners: </b>ESFP personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and too often they don’t bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, believing that they could change at any moment.",
                "WEAKNESSES:<br><br><b>5. Unfocused: </b>Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for people with the ESFP personality type. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects. The trick for them is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done.",
            ],
            "Romantic Relationships" => [
                "People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) are social, fun-loving, free-spirited individuals who live life in the moment and squeeze every little bit of excitement from everything. Naturally, they don’t spare any of this freshness and energy when dating. For ESFP personalities, relationships aren’t about slowly building foundations for the future or planning out a life – they are bubbling, unpredictable things to be enjoyed for as long as there’s enjoyment to be had.",
                "<b>The Spark of Love: </b>Interestingly, ESFPs tend to regard falling in love as the best part of a relationship. They revel most in the stages that involve intense emotions, passion, discovery, and excitement. As a result, they might strive to keep these sparks lit longer than normal by investing more in the flavorful aspects of their relationship. Because of this investment in liveliness and joy, relationships with ESFPs are simply unforgettable. People with this personality type always have some new and exciting activity up their sleeve, and they genuinely enjoy spending each moment with their partner. ESFPs enjoy physical intimacy immensely, and they prove themselves affectionate, inquisitive, and open-minded, loving to share with willing and reciprocative partners. Conversation with ESFPs is similar, focusing on fun, sometimes quirky subjects rather than deep, soul-searching expressions. The past and the future, the sciences and politics, and long-term plans and commitments are all less likely to grip ESFP personalities than brighter, more tangible things. They slow things down and add too much weight to their freewheeling style.",
                "<b>The Rise of Conflict: </b>Emotionally oriented and sensitive, people with the ESFP personality type often respond poorly to outside “suggestions” on how to manage their love lives. They respond even worse if criticisms come from their partner, and trying to take emotions out of the picture by telling them to “not take this personally” isn’t helpful either. Slowing down and handling these situations better is a growth area for ESFPs. On the other hand, the issue can be a lack of any criticism at all. ESFP personalities value social input a lot and are almost as affected by their friends’ opinions of their dating partner as their own. Since they are attracted to people who share their attitudes, this can leave them in an echo chamber that only tells them what they want to hear, reinforcing counterproductive behaviors and attitudes.",
                "<b>A Joyful Heart: </b>All of these tendencies can present a challenge for people with this personality type later on. ESFPs’ tendency to avoid promises and commitments sabotages important long-term goals. Building real relationships takes time and conscious effort. But ESFPs are incredibly likable people who enjoy life’s small pleasures. Enthusiastic and affectionate, with a pure and down-to-earth love that just takes things at face value, ESFPs ultimately take the time to find someone who they truly enjoy being with every day rather than settling too soon for stability over happiness."
            ],
            "Friendships" => [
                "People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) are known for their irrepressibly social and excited attitudes. They don’t internalize much of anything, sharing it all with their extensive circles of friends with wit, style, enthusiasm, and optimism. They are explorers of the pleasures of life, and they take particular pleasure in sharing those experiences with others. For ESFPs, there’s no point in living if you can’t feel alive.",
                "<b>Making Life Interesting: </b>ESFPs are people of action. Getting out with activities that engage the senses is this personality type’s idea of a good time. Sometimes, though, they may go too far with risky or careless behaviors and try to bring others along for the ride. They are sensitive, and rejection of these pastimes can be taken personally, leading to conflict or drama. They don’t have time to be lectured. Making new friends isn’t a problem for these types. ESFPs use an alluring combination of blunt truths, disarming openness, and charm to keep things moving. Where ESFP personalities falter is in keeping up with the friends they already have. In their excitement and focus on the here and now over history, they might too easily pursue the next adventure that a new person has to offer, regretting that their older friend seems to have changed and become less fun.",
                "<b>Thrill Seekers: </b>This can all give the impression that ESFPs are shallow, pleasure-centric creatures who care little for anyone but themselves – but this is a terrible misunderstanding, and far from the truth! They care sincerely about their friends. It’s why they put so much effort into coming up with group experiences that they believe everyone will enjoy, and they are deeply distressed by the occasional conflicts that hurt these relationships. For all their effort to bring new people in, ESFPs extend an incredible sense of loyalty to their existing friends. They are great listeners and are often attuned to shifts in mood or behavior, making them adept at offering comfort during difficult times. People with this personality type find great satisfaction in helping their friends, and their support often goes beyond mere words."
            ],
            "Parenthood" => [
                "People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) are some of the most relaxed, fun-loving parents out there. From the first moment they hold their babies, they are taken with the joy and wonder that their children experience in everything around them. Playing with children is a genuine pleasure for ESFPs, and they are constantly devising new and exciting ways to keep their children happy, excited, and engaged.",
                "<b>Wild and Free: </b>Exploration and experiences are key philosophies for ESFP parents – when their children ask questions, the answer is, “Let’s find out!” Overbearing structures and tightly scheduled activities aren’t a big part of this personality type’s parenting. They’d much rather take things day by day and break up the crust by letting their children explore something new in their own way, something much appreciated by their children. Of course, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t any rules – they were young once too! Discipline is far from their strongest suit, but hindsight and maturity have their effects. ESFPs are often keen to prevent their children from suffering the same hurts and setbacks that they themselves experienced. If that means these parents have to crack down from time to time, they will lovingly lay down the law with their kids. One of the greatest strengths of ESFP parents is that they provide plenty of emotional support. While not especially demanding parents, warm affection, practicality, and adaptability give people with the ESFP personality type a very nurturing and encouraging parenting style. When their children declare themselves future astronauts, ESFPs happily build make-believe spaceships and later use those declarations to help their children focus on their schoolwork and goals. And when the dream switches to archaeology, these parents are right there beside them, chisel in hand – knowing that it all leads to the same wondrous path of discovery.",
            ],
            "Career Paths" => [
                "People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) have a unique quality that makes them exceptional in some careers and miserable in others – they mirror the mood around them. When they are at a party or concert, they reflect that mood, giving them that “party people” image. When their friends are sad, they mirror that with sympathy and empathy. And when there is a crisis, ESFPs adapt as well, matching the intensity of the situation. As a result, just about any career that focuses on working with others is a good fit for ESFP personalities to be happy and productive. Moreover, their natural charm and vivacity help them create impressions that last and form alliances that may prove beneficial in the long run. The old adage, “It’s not what you know, but who you know,” resonates deeply with them.",
                "<b>Seeking New Challenges: </b>As natural-born networkers, ESFPs flourish in roles that allow them to socialize and foster connections. These personalities are great event planners, sales representatives, trip planners, and tour guides, as each of these careers creates a sense of excitement, stimulation, and novelty between them and their customers. They genuinely enjoy spending time with others and have a knack for making people happy in even the most frustrating situations. A good challenge is always appreciated by ESFP personalities, and they make wonderful and inspiring counselors, social workers, personal coaches, and consultants who improve employee or customer satisfaction. With their ability to respond with resourcefulness and passion when their help is badly needed, ESFPs make brilliant medical professionals, especially as EMTs, paramedics, and nurses. They quickly pick up information about others, helping them get straight to the heart of the issue when dealing with the sick or injured. They thrive on intense emotion, and there’s hardly a better place for it. Not everybody has the energy for that, though, or wants the responsibility of life and death – some ESFPs prefer to make others happy and excited by creating beauty instead. People with this personality type have plenty of creative energy, and many of them build fulfilling careers in music, fashion, photography, and interior design. ESFPs are renowned for their sense of style.",
                "<b>A Touch of Chaos: </b>However, jobs that eliminate human contact and focus on impartial, data-driven decisions can be torturous. Some do well enough by blowing off steam with friends after work, but for the most part, careers that are harsh or power-driven are poor fits. Add ESFP personalities’ discomfort with schedules, structures, and repetition, and repetitive, uncreative work is also often quickly sent to the “nope” bin. Regardless of where their diverse passions lie, ESFPs need freedom, novelty, and, above all, human contact. People with this personality type need to know that they aren’t just appreciated (though that is very important) but liked. When ESFPs come into work, they want to see a touch of chaos and to be able to navigate it with a team of capable friends who are all too happy to take action by their side."
            ],
            "Workplace Habits" => [
                "The cubicle life rarely suits these outgoing individuals. People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) prefer more dynamic, social spaces where they can easily strike up conversations and exchange ideas. There’s hardly a better type to have around in an energetic, hectic work environment. The more freedom that they have to do what they’ve got to do, the better the results – so long as they know what the goal is. That said, regardless of what position they find themselves in at work, ESFPs share a desire to make the environment as friendly and enjoyable as possible. To do so, these personalities tend to maintain a social and relaxed attitude, and they use it to get everyone else on board with practical tasks that need to be done.",
                "<b>ESFP Subordinates: </b>As subordinates, ESFPs thrive on change and new ideas, and they chafe under repetitive and strictly defined tasks. These personalities’ managers find willing and able experimenters who can brainstorm, quickly grasp new methods, and actually put those methods to practical use – so long as they have a little leeway to apply their own creative style. Changes may take a few tries though, as they can be forgetful in the heat of the moment and can get more caught up in trying to get quick returns. ESFPs give honest feedback on whether things make sense, but they can sometimes be quite sensitive to others’ criticism of their own habits. Under fire, people with this personality type can become defensive and easily upset. But in the end, if they believe that the criticism comes from an honest intent to help, not hurt, they take it to heart. The biggest struggle for ESFP subordinates is that they value freedom far more than safety and security – if their conditions aren’t met, they won’t shy away from finding a new opportunity.",
                "<b>ESFP Colleagues: </b>If anyone can make friends with their colleagues and keep tension at bay within their team, it’s ESFPs. A fun atmosphere is important, and people with this personality type use their strong observational and social skills to bring everyone together, shifting a souring mood if need be. They rarely struggle to come up with ideas on how to make this happen, happily organizing events and activities inside and outside the workplace. ESFPs’ spontaneity, wit, and enthusiasm have no equal. This is important because, for these engaged personalities, a sense of fun and camaraderie go hand-in-hand with good, hard work.",
                "<b>ESFP Managers: </b>As managers, ESFPs do everything they can to pump energy and fun into the day-to-day work that needs to be done. These personalities enjoy being the center of attention, and even more so they like to feel like they’re needed and appreciated. Jumping into the thick of the work and applying themselves to anything they’d ask their subordinates to do is something ESFPs consider part of the job. Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they’re an important part of a team that gets the job done. ESFPs are great at noticing others’ moods, and there are few personality types better at preventing conflict and encouraging relaxed, enjoyable workplaces. Subordinates are always welcome to speak their minds, and ESFPs are always happy to hear others out, especially if something is upsetting them. Their ability to relate to others and think on their feet makes them resourceful and inspiring leaders."
